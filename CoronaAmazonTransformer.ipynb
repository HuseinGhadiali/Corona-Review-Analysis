The only other thing I bought was a supply line, but that is more dependent on your current plumbing. Instructions were clear to follow. Mounting the tank with the included three bolts worked well. There weren't any leaks like other reviews mentioned. Making sure all three bolts are tightened the same amount was key.\n",

Very good price for a comfort height toilet plus it comes with a close close toilet seat. Its great to be able to purchase a really solid product that is manufactured in the USA.\n",

But, I have opened the packaging and instructions and can tell this is a quality product as I have installed several toilets before. I especially like the fact that it comes with the seat and the wax ring included. Toilets are usually very easy to install so I do not anticipate any problems with the install.\n",

It has the features we want (few do these days): standard, not chair height; and round bowl, not elongated. Also, it is priced much less than Kohler and other brands, yet is quality made in the USA. We're very happy with Mansfield!\n",

Only two problems, and both were with the T bolts holding the toilet to the floor. First, the T bolts had a tendency to fall over when setting the bowl over them since there was nothing to hold them up. I used a small piece of cardboard pushed over them to hold them up. The next problem, and the bigger of the two, the T bolts were too long. The finishing caps wouldn't fit because the hit the end of the T bolts. Had to use a hack saw to cut them down to fit. Either supply longer caps to fit over the bolts, or supply shorter bolts.\n",

The smartheight is ADA compliant which allows for easy sit and stand which helps with arthritic knees. The powerful flush only uses 1.28 gpf which saves on water usage while still emptying the bowl. The slow close seat is really slow, but at least it doesn’t slam shut. The tank fill is rather quiet and easy to adjust. All and all, I am happy with this toilet and am glad that I don’t have sit so low.\n",

This one was no exception, what should have been a two hour project took almost three times as long. First remove the old toilet only to find the flange is destroyed and will take ingenuity and lots of work. Many hours later I have the new flange and wax ring (provided with this toilet) in place ready for installation. This toilet bolted in very easily but I had to use plastic connector bolt different from the ones provided. These were recommended by a plumber when I was addressing the broken flange issue. I went to connect the toilet to the water supply but alas they did not provide that water line. Trying to reuse the old one it broke because part of it was plastic. It took three trips to Lowe’s to get the correct new shut-off valve and water fill line. Mostly my fault for not trying the connection at the store. The best part of this whole installation was the toilet itself, in the past I would have had to install the guts of the toilet myself adding time and expense. While this is only the third toilet I have ever installed it was by far the easiest. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to install a new toilet. I did spend a bit of time hunting for the plastic bolts for the seat, and finally decided to use the old ones figuring that they were not shipped or that I had misplaced them. After the new seat was installed I lifted the lid to conduct a test flush only to find the new plastic bolts taped conveniently to the underside of the lid.\n",

But the toilet installed fairly well. I don't like how the tank connects to the bowl, The gap is really large.\n",

Make sure that you have someone to help carry the box to the area of the install prior to unpacking if you can. All of the items were included for the install which saves time and trips for something that you may have forgotten. Be sure to clean the flange area prior to installing the new seal. I found that installing the bowl by itself without the tank was easier for me to handle. The tank was easy to attach. Be sure to not overtighten any of the fittings. Once ...\n",

Solid waste flushes easily, but occasionally requires an extra flush to leave the bowl looking clean. I replaced my 3.6 GPF and would never be able to do a second flush without waiting for it to refill. This tank holds plenty of water so you to make that extra flush without waiting. Make sure to depress the handle completely to activate the refill valve. Of note, the seat is probably going to be a pain to clean the hinge area as its all open and dust and debris will undoubtedly collect.\n",

Got this one. Very easy to install. Directions were clear and easy to follow. Came with all the parts. Very comfortable. I love the gloss white finish. Flushes very well. Could definitely see myself replacing another with this same exact toilet. Would recommend to anyone\n",

Bought it online, picked it up shortly thereafter in the curbside pickup. Good price and great service from Lowe's. It's what they do!\n",

This makes it difficult to keep seat upright for those of us who stand up to be relieved. Everything is in the kit, and it flushes quickly and effectively without \"swirl\" effect. Be careful to select 10\" or 12\" (12\" is most common) and we chose the elongated a higher rise toilet..... what a nice difference over the 12-14\" high units with round bowl!\n",

I had no leaks at all and it works great! I would have given it 5 stars but i did noticed that if you hold down handle a couple of seconds that you do get a better flush but works fine with quick flush. All in all the toilet looks great and it works well!\n",

It only takes one flush to clear the bowl which is fast and strong. It is easy to install everything is included except a wrench. The redesigned seat is a little tricky but worth the few extra minutes to install. Very simple to remove push a silver button and it lifts off to clean underneath then pop it back on the two pins and your done. When it is in the up position the seat fits into the lid with two little tabs to assist to open or close.\n",

In our rush to make a purchase, as it was needed right away, we initially used google for a recommendation and purchased one made by Delta. Immediately, we noticed the water flow during flushing was poor. I called Delta and was told they were aware of the issue and that multiple flushes and frequent cleanings were recommended. So, I started doing some research to replace it. Mansfield Summit was the solution. Installation was standard and the flush was exactly what was expected; one flush for solids. My parents are very pleased. Cons, the seat that comes with it is poorly constructed, a disappointment. You will need to replace it. I’m not kidding, it’s that bad. Also, Mansfield packages their toilets upside down, so don’t be thrown off when you open the box. By the way, it is made in the USA. We were all very happy about that!\n",
      "5                                                                                                                                                                                                              We are renovating a small half bath, and we needed to replace an old high-flow toilet. We chose the round bowl because of our limited space between the toilet and the vanity. This new toilet fits our small space and looks very good. The package included everything needed for a complete installation except the line from the water supply to the tank inlet. They really could not include that line because I needed to measure the distance to buy the correct line length. Everything was packaged compactly in an single box with lifting handles on the sides. An inner box contains the tank, tank cover, and instructions. I didn't notice that the cover was packed below the tank until after removing the tank from the box. The instructions were clear, and the installation was reasonable. It was easy to set the toilet square and level, and there were no leaks after following the instructions. Before trying this toilet, I had some general concern about the effectiveness of the low-flow operation, but this toilet appears to have a powerful flush. The tank is almost as large as the one on the old high-flow toilet, but the mechanism appears to meter less than half of the tank capacity for each flush. The weight of the remaining water provides more force for the limited water that is delivered in a flush. Each flush appears to clear the bowl completely, and we have not had any problems with it. This bowl height of this toilet is higher than the one that we replaced. Our consensus is that this height is more comfortable than the lower bowl, but I expect that is a matter of personal preference. This provided a good solution for our particular renovation need. It fits our small space, works well, and looks good.\n",

The tank is smaller so less water waste. The bowl is smooth and will be easy to clean. In stall was quick and easy came with everything needed except new water line. The plastic seat and lid seem a little to commercial so I will be replacing that. Comes with bees wax gasket to seal toilet to the flange in the floor. This toilet bowl has three holes at the tank attachment be careful not to over tighten here or were it mounts to the floor because it is Ceramic glass and will break if you apply too much torque pressure on the bolts and nuts. So be careful! All and all though this is a great toilet flushes good and is clean and white. I would recommend this product to you.\n",

I have bad hips and knees and I’m 74 years old. My regular height toilet was hard for me to set down on due to the height and after getting my new chair height toilet it’s so much easier to sit down and get back up. I truly love it❤️\n",

Others mentioned the loudness of the flush, and while it is louder than the old toilet we had I don't find it really loud. My tall husband didn't like the plastic toilet seat flexing, so we got a harder wooden toilet seat to replace the one that came with. Very happy with this toilet.\n",

All parts were included except the line to connect the commode to the water supply. I purchased brass floor bolts to use instead of the steel ones supplied by the manufacturer, because they are rust-proof and were easier to saw off (both the original and the brass ones were too long). I like the forceful swirl-type flush. Time will tell if it is effective in cleaning the bowl well, but I expect it to. I also like that the toilet seat is a no-slam design. The push-button quick removal design of the toilet seat is also a nice hygienic touch. The old one had a hard to clean area under the hinge section.\n",

It works well and comes with everything needed for installation and use except the toilet supply line (most toilets don't include that). Flushing pressure is very good but not great. It could be a little better. This toilet also sits pretty low. I am not sure if there is a higher / chair height available. Everything else is pretty standard and fits well. On the back of the tank lid there is a sticker with the names and serial numbers for all replacement parts which I have not seen on a toilet before and is a smart addition.\n",

The tank to toilet securing bolts (3) have a nice hard rubber non-round head on them for easy gripping. Problem: The rubber head did not cover the bolt hole entirely, almost, but not quite. Consequently, it leaked pretty bad. I had them as tight as I could get them without cracking the toilet, but still leaked. I fussed for several hours including another trip to LOWES to fix the leak. After I got the leak under control, I appreciated how it flushed. Very nice. In my opinion, the tank mounting hardware needs rethinking, but I'm still buying a second one! I would give this toilet 5 stars easy if the tank mounting hardware worked.\n",

After 2 flushes you have to tap because it will not fall so it will fill the tank. Was told by the lowes store where I bought it that they wouldn’t switch valves that I would have to return the whole unit ! But I was also told that Lowes will not accept a toilet once it’s been installed ! Figure that out ?\n",

The chair height is just too high in a bathroom used primarily by our younger kids (6+). Overall, this toilet is a toilet. I hit the flush lever and it flushes. That's what I need it to do and it does it well. Waste goes away when I hit flush...that's a win. For install, it went smoothly. Removed the old toilet, cleaned the old wax off the flange, then began installing the new toilet. I only have one criticism...the hardware kit that comes with the toilet doesn't have the nice little plastic washers to help hold the flange bolts up while you install the bowl. You can see in pic #3 where I used small pieces of cardboard to hold the bolts up. It works, but it wouldn't be too much to ask for Mansfield to include simple, cheap, thin plastic washers to hold the bolts up. Other than that, install was smooth. Got the bowl installed then put the tank on the back. After that, I connected the water feed, turned on the water, and checked for leaks...there were none! It was a smooth install and the toilet does exactly what a toilet should. The waste goes away and I know I have a quality toilet that is going to last!\n",

The removal of a 30+ year old round toilet and the installation of this higher, elongated commode was a relatively easy process. I removed all the old wax ring, used my Simple Green to clean the floor and followed the simple instructions. I did adjust the tank level to a lower setting. This is a fast flush unit that will give you two flush cycles on one tank of water. So it is indeed a much more efficient unit than the old one and I think better than our two which are less than five years old.

They called me and set up delivery. On the day of the delivery the driver called and gave me a 30 minute heads up, worked out great. Toilet took me about an hour to install myself and that included taking out the old one!!! So far so good. Nice made and finished.\n",

Just thought I would be proactive. Took longer than I expected. But I am not the most skilled handyman around. However it works excellent and looks good. And best yet it is made in America!!!.

We had trouble finding a toilet that would fit in our bathroom because we have a baseboard for heat behind the toilet. We a so needed a toilet in bone because our new tub and sink are both bone. There are not many bone toilets available for purchase in any store. This toilet twas able to fit because it's base footprint is not as long behind the floor bolt as the majoy of toilets being sold. It has a nice powerful flush which is quieter than our previous toilet and uses less water. We love it!\n",

I reduced it by one star because it only has two bolts holding the tank to the bowl. Since the toilet displays are mounted on the wall over 6 feet high, I was unable to see that at the time of purchase.\n",

Easy to hook up. Everything you need is in the box, even the wax ring. Somewhat of a water saver due to it's smaller tank. Just a regular flapper design flush system. Works fine and a good value.\n",

The installation of the new commode was easy as the tank parts were already installed and they stayed in place and caused no trouble during the installation. Everything went in the proper place and I only had one tank bolt that caused a little leak at first. I kept adjusting until it stopped. The only reason I'm giving it a four is for two reasons. The toilet seat is a cheap version and probably won't last very long. The other reason is the toilet isn't tall enough. I think the tall version is 17 inches high (Not sure of that). As I'm now 77 years old and finding difficulty in getting up and down, I see this as a potential problem. But, overall, the commode is a good product and well worth what it sales for. I'm satisfied with it and would recommend it.\n",

If you look at Lowes reviews of Mansfield, Kohler and American Standard you see many of the same quality problems. No wonder they sell for 1/2 of plumbing supply houses. In 8 hours at work my new toilet leaks half the contents of the bowl on my new floor. The toilet obviously has a crack or defect in the trap. I just ordered the same brand from a plumbing supply and when I asked the guy on the phone if the had many problems with that brand, he said \"none\". Coincidence?\n",

The Toilet comes with everything I needed to replace my existing toilet. The only tools required was a Crescent Wrench, Philip Screw driver and Pliers. i like how simple it was to adjust the water level, there a line on the fill tube. The instruction was easy to follow.

It installs very quickly, make sure to tighten all the bolts slowly you don't want to crack anything. The bolts for the back tank are easy and the seat installs with a screwdriver. We Replaced the smaller toilet that originally came in the basement. The elongated bowl and the higher seat makes this a all around nice upgrade.\n",

So, it's a dual-flush without the extra cost...? Installation went surprisingly well for being my first toilet installation ever. Manufacturer provides clear instructions that made it easy, although I must say it was disconcerting to read, paraphrasing, \"Tighten all three tank-to-bowl nuts, fill tank, and check for leaks. If it leaks, tighten them each 1/2 turn and recheck.\" Hmmm. Mine did not leak at all, so I'm satisfied overall.\n",

Has a sleek design that elevates the look of the bathroom. Install is simple and comes with all the parts you need. The slow close lid is nice that it’s not loud when shut. I have a couple kids and am constantly asking them not to slam the lid. Nice that it’s not possible now. That said the lid (not the seat) is a little flimsy and I’m not able to sit on it without it bending in. I don’t think it’ll break but I also won’t be testing it. I also found the water refilling noise to be quite loud. I did turn the water down from fully open and that did eliminate it. Good to note if you have higher home water pressure. Other then that it’s been working great. If you’re looking to update the look of an older bathroom this could be a good fit.\n",

Nice style and everything that you need to install it, the only thing that I found difficult were the instructions! The top tank leaked a little when I installed it but it was soon taken care of! The large nut that holds the inside together was loose, a simple tightening and I was set! Great value and super quiet. Only takes a minute to refill after flushing!\n",

It replaced an older,lower 1 piece kohler unit. I wanted to do an American Standard, but none were available in bone/off white & elongated, chair height at my local Lowe's. Other option was a Kohler model, but it had some fancy piston flushing valve system. Saw this Mansfield Denali unit, simple fluid master flush system, reviews looked good, made in USA. So gave it a shot. Packaged extremely well, nothing broke, damaged etc. Quick easy directions Installed real nice & looks great. Flushes like a champ Really glad I gave it a shot\n",

The closet has 3 bolts that fixes it to the bowl. 2/3 were hard to reach and if you do not tighten them down equally, the closet will not be level. All other aspects of this toilet were OK\n",

I chose this over similar models from the other names because it is American made and nicely priced. I like the 3\" rigid flapper with replaceable silicone rubber seal a lot. It closes with a slight bang, but the flush is amazingly powerful, especially considering the efficiency. I think a softer rubber universal replacement flapper would make it quieter, but in my powder room, the noise is no issue. I like that it has 3 tank bolts instead of 2. The patented bolt design is strange, but I still like it better than Kohler's 3-bolt/funky seal design. There is no need for lots of torque, but you must be methodical in tightening them. Do it gradually in an alternating pattern like with lug nuts. The documentation indicates the correct order. I learned if you rush that step, it will leak. Look out for stray bits of loose glazing in the tank box and make sure there are none in the fill valve before connecting the supply. The pre-assembled tank components required no adjustments at all. The seat seems cheap, but it will do the job until it breaks.\n",

It sets back in front so it was great for our one tiny bathroom. (We purchased two toilets) Both had more room behind them and I like having more room to clean therel. The tank is smaller and fit right next to the wall. One of our previous toilets had set several inches away from the wall. The design on the outside looks like it will be easier to clean and keep clean as well. The flush sounds strong and seems to rinse the toilet bowl well. The flush is loud and makes a pretty good 'thunk' as the stopper drops in place. The chain needed adjusting and one of them broke as it was so thin. The flushing handle seems cheap and flimsy. The slow-close seats are plastic, very lightweight, take forever to close, and keep coming loose. We will be replacing them. The money we spent seemed to be in the china parts of these toilets. The lightweight chain, flimsy feeling flushing handle and cheap lightweight seats were disappointing.\n",

Everything you need between your water supply line and your toilet flange in the floor. ADA compliant \"comfort\" height makes getting up and down significantly easier for older people, people with disabilities, or people with arthritis and general mobility issues. This toilet has very nice finishes. Love the snap on, quick release toilet seat, which will make cleaning way easier too. Can't ask for anything more.\n",

      "175                                                                                                                Likes: Mansfield customer service was awesome. I called and spoke with them twice while deciding on purchasing this and they were very helpful. It's pretty (no logos on it anywhere, my wife likes handle on the side) and is solidly built/heavy. The flush is very strong when you hold the handle down (see dislikes) and it has anti-stick coating like other higher-end brand toilets. I chose it over similar American Standard (Champion) and Kohler (Cimmaron) toilets available at Lowes because these toilets have serious quality control issues (cracking and issues with flush valves, respectively). I did NOT use the included wax ring but instead used the Danco 4.75-in Toilet Wax Ring with Bolts Item #: 3844101 Model #: 10826X which I highly recommend as this allows you to reposition toilet if needed and it's a very secure fit on this toilet. Dislikes: You must hold the handle down to get a good flush. I talked to Mansfield about this and it's the way it's designed. The flapper they have doesn't float at all. I have purchased a new flapper to try from HomeDepot (Fluidmaster Universal 3 in. Premium Adjustable Toilet Flapper) that I'm hoping will allow for a good flush without holding the handle down. The flush is loud and the flapper slams down hard if you don't hold the handle down long enough. Also, it takes a long time for the tank to fill after flushing and it's louder than our previous toilet-most of the water goes into the bowl and not the tank. My wife feels the toilet sits a little high, but I'm fine with it-we're the same height so personal preference. Overall I'm pretty happy with the toilet and was VERY impressed with Mansfield's customer service. I had a hard time finding any information about this toilet before I bought, so I'm hoping this review helps other people decide on it.\n",

Installation was fairly easy, I had a little trouble getting the tank to bowl connection to not leak, but just wasn't tightening the plastic nuts enough. So far it is flushing well, not plugging.

Wax ring was used. Lid busted. Why put it back in stock? Second one. Checked it out. In tact. Started install and realized the tank mounting hardware was gone. Ran to Lowes and they yanked it from the busted unit. All good. Then during tank install I noticed a casting imperfection that those sketchy looking mount bolts would likely not seal. Gorilla sealant on hand I shot that on the mating faces. Here's to hop because I need this toilet up to finish the flooring in another bathroom. Will have to think about the toilet for the next room. I will say the employee was very helpful to sort this out easily\n",

It flushes everything in one flash. Everything is included wax ring and mounting bolts. The stuff in the tank is preassembled which allow an easy installation. I would recommend this toilet for anyone.\n",

Denali are made in Ohio, by a company founded in the 1920's that employs hundreds of people in a small town. The Denai toilet if very well made, with a very powerful flush as promised! My plumber had little trouble installing it. Should anything go wrong inside, it should be easy to fix. The price was only about twenty dollars more than \"American Standard\"'s equivalent model. I am happy to pay just a bit more to support American workers and Made in U.S.A. products.\n",

Instructions were simple and the rubber-headed tank bolts create a great seal. That said, a few things to keep in mind: 1. Buy an extra wax ring. If you’ve had a remodel that includes granite or marble flooring, odds are good the supplied ring won’t be thick enough to create a good seal. Having a second ring will allow you to double the depth. Wax rings run about $2.00, so go ahead and splurge—it could save you a trip back to the store; 2. When attaching the tank, you’ll need to stretch the rubber gasket a bit to seat it flush to the bottom of the tank. The instructions are a bit vague on that, and you’ll be going through a couple of towels if you don’t! The toilet itself is pretty good. The oblong shape is far more comfortable than traditional round bowls. A quick flick of the handle drains about half the tank (thereby conserving water) and holding the handle down will completely drain it (for when a little more oomph is needed). What I like best is that the tank is very quiet when refilling. All said, a good product that’s easy to install.\n",

The two piece (bowl & tank) seem to be made very well. Unlike other toilets I have purchased this one comes with everything needed included the wax ring. All plumbing inside the tank pre-assembled to help speed up the installation process.\n",

Having everything needed in the box for install is great. The toilet seat is kind of cheap and thin and doesn't feel overly durable. I'd you've never installed a toilet using the directions in reverse to remove the existing toilet is extremely helpful. The tank bolts having built in gaskets was amazing and made it very easy to seat the tank and not worry that it was going to leak. Very happy with this product overall.\n",

Easy to install, especially if you've done one before. Even if you haven't, it's still easy, since all the tank parts are already installed. This is the comfort height, so it's more suitable for taller people. I'm 5'5\", but it is in a bathroom that belongs to someone taller then me! Everything you need is included.\n",

The toilet itself is very solid and well constructed it included the wax ring and all hardware needed to put this together in about 30 minutes. the Tank mounted really solid and I didn't have to crank down on the nuts to get it to seal.

My pickup experience was fine. My plumber installed them easily and quickly. I was replacing old, round bowl, low-to-the-floor toilets. I love the elongated bowl and, as a tall person, I especially love the chair height. These toilets have a strong jet rinse and slow-closing seats that do not make a slamming sound. They seem to be easy to keep nice and clean. You do have to hold the flush handle down for a half a second instead of letting go immediately but that's not really an issue. I hate to admit it but I was so excited to get these new toilets and I am not disappointed.\n",

The flush is superb. Takes care of removing everything and leaves nothing unwanted behind. This is the 2nd toilet in our home. We love the great flushing and low water usage on this toilet. Would definitely buy again.\n",

I had a plumber install, and he said it was very easy, no problems at. He didn't really like the way the tank sat on the bowl, but there has been no problems with it at all. I really like the quick flush, and only have to hold down if needing to do a full flush.Have only had in installed for one week.\n",

Solid, made-in-USA product with Fluidmaster internals means it's going to last. I replaced a 20-year-old Crane toilet and the process was seamless. I was admittedly a bit leery about the \"smart fastener\" tank-to-bowl fasteners, but they worked as advertised. Although this unit comes with all needed parts, I used the Fluidmaster wax-free base seal, which mated perfectly to this unit. I would definitely buy this unit again -- and it's only a few bucks more than the Chinese-made budget models.\n",

The toilet has a large jet at the bottom that helps push waste to the drain (see photo). THE NEUTRAL: The flapper has a unique design as the hole on one side is larger than the hole on the other side. Not a big deal as Lowe's sells the Mansfield flapper (item # 4133941). If you care to upgrade to a better flapper, you will greatly increase your flush performance (Lowe's item # 4133941), see photo. The Fluid Master fill valve comes with a flow restrictor which means that it takes a long time to refill the tank after each flush. Instructions for removing the flow restrictor can be found my Googling \"How to remove the toilet fill valve regulator.\" COULD BE BETTER: There are no rubber washers or spacers used to level & support the tank as you secure it to the toilet. After failing to get a good seal, I placed 3 tank toilet washers on top of each of the 3 holes on the toilet, then I placed the tank on the toilet (see photo). The Lowe's item # on the tank washers is 3625389. The tank was immediately level and stable, and the seal was perfect. Overall the Mansfield toilet is a quality product at a good price. If you add the rubber tank washers as spacers, you don't have to worry about porcelain to porcelain contact as the tank to toilet washer is compressed by the weight of the water in the tank. As stated, you can upgrade to the other brand flapper and greatly improve your flush performance.\n",

I notice immediately it was much heavier that the Kol toilet it was replacing. Nothing cheap about it. Guts are standard flowmaster, nothing fancy but solid stuff. Packaged perfect, parts in individual boxes with good instructions. Delivery was delayed but it's holiday time so not a problem. Easy installation for most part. Toilet mount bolts were too short for my tiled floor. Had to purchase 3.5 lag bolts, no big deal. Toilet water bowl is the 2 bolt mount. No issue with leaks, bolted up nice, however still has a little tilt forward so I shimmed tank with small piece of plastic shim to level it out. Toilet seat self closing- First time I ever had to look at instructions to mount a toilet seat! Probably took longer to mount seat that the complete toilet. Didn't help that my wife was watching and wanted it perfectly line up! Very satisfied with this toilet. No leaks, straight forward install. Very quiet operation. Flushes well and cleans up easy. Wife says it looks very high standard compared to contractor grade toilets. Much happier now with the lever flush than the center top lid push button on other toilet.\n",

Good things about this toilet is it’s powerful flush. Toilet looks and installs just like all the others. I see no difference appearance wise compared to other brands. Box is a complete toilet install kit with everything. Install was easy. Typical install directions\n",

It is working fine and the flushing action is very powerful. Don't know how it works, but when you flush it sounds like water is being pushed in with force and sucked out as well. When we installed it, the tank bolts didn't line-up perfectly with the bowl so when we thought everything was ready to test, it leaked a little at one of the bolts. Loosening the bolt and wiggling a little resolved the problem and there has been no problem since then. If we decide to replace our remaining chair height toilet with a comfort height one, we will buy this one again.\n",

Because of that the tank only slightly empties, unless you stand there and hold the lever down. I’m going to replace all the tank parts to get around this ridiculous oversight.

Decided it was time to bite the bullet and replace it with a lower one. Wasn't looking forward to the job, but this Mansfield Pro-Fit Standard Height was really easy to install. It came with everything you need to finish the job. No need to go back to the store (as usual) to get parts that you don't have. The attachment screws, nuts, etc. worked well. Especially appreciated the ease of attached the top section. No l...\n",

The height is perfect, and although the lid did feel a more narrow… I still give it a 5. Normally you wouldn’t be there for very long so it wasn’t a dealbreaker (right?).\n",

All waste is removed with one flush. The seat is soft-close and recessed into the lif which is a nice look. The seat also has a quick release button for easy cleaning. The flush is a little louder than other toilets but not terrible. The only negative is that i had to replace the flush valve as the toilet leaked continually. Even after several attempts at reinstalling. Not a big deL since the part is cheap and easy to awap ou.\n",

Because we are a commercial operation, we opted to adjust the float downward to allow more water per flush. It is done easily by removing the plastic keeper from the chain and moving the float to a lower position and reinstalling the keeper. Overall, a very nice toilet. We have installed many in our facilities and haven't had any problems at all. The included seats are plastic, they work fine but are not as sturdy as solid seats. note: Be careful not to overtighten the mounting bolts, they will break.\n",

The kit is complete from the floor up ( except for the connecting water line). When I received the box it was very well packaged with adequate amounts of heavy duty triple wall corrugated box and other packing material as needed. The kit is complete with the toilet base, the toilet tank, the float and valve assembly for inside the tank and the toilet seat as well as all the hardware needed and the wax ring. The included instructions are complete and straightforward. The toilet complete setup job only took me about 30 minutes once I had removed my old one. I really like the classic modern design and it blended well with the white porcelain tub and sink and the chrome hardware on same. I certainly give this a thumbs up.\n",

Went very smoothly. We like the fact that it sits higher than our old one. That and the slow close lid were 2 things we were looking for when we chose which toilet we were going to buy. Our only complaint is the seat/lid is very cheaply made. We’ll be going back to the store and buying a new seat for it. Otherwise I’d have given it 5 stars.\n",

I selected this toilet as a replacement for the top flushing toilet my youngest was having problem pushing the button. The toilet is too short for us at our height, but worked perfectly and installed quickly. We kept it for 4 days before my knees complained. Now, I just let him handle things, I was trying to help, but this toilet is perfect for children or those who are closer to the floor. Not for tall people at all. Good look, sturdy.\n",

It stands a little higher making it much easier to get off of and is built heavy duty making it sit firm in place while installing and using. Had everything I needed for the install. This is a gorgeous looking toilet.\n",

Scared me the first time I flushed it. It comes with easy to install instructions which is a plus, all the hardware you need to install the toilet minus your water supply line comes in the box. I do not care for the toilet seat that accompanies this system. I feel that the seat is cheap and the hole in which you use is too small. I am not a large person and it still feels uncomfortable, and the screws that come with it to install the seat are extremely long, could definitely use shorter screws and metal not plastic would be nice. Also when installing the tank to the base, you might want to have a 17mm socket available to help tighten down the bowl. Once the toilet is in place, you only have a few inches from the wall to try and secure the screws provided. I used a 17mm socket to help secure the nuts to the bolts. Overall since I just installed this last night, I do like this product and think with a few minor changes it would be the perfect product.\n",

This was ship to be common carrier and the outside of the box was a little messed up. However, when I open the box all the components were completely intact. No breakage or scratches. This one is a comfort height or chair height. It is approximately17” from the floor to the top of the bowl with the seat up. The quality is apparent right out of the box. The internal flush valve and flapper are quality. The unit is quiet and refill is quick. I am sure this will last a least 40 years or more which is way past my lifetime. Looking for a new quality quiet toilet? Look no further. BUY IT.\n",

This toilet is not the fanciest design-wise but it is user-friendly and plumber-friendly. You will always find replacement flappers or fill valves down the road when they need to be replaced. Mansfield is a reputable company, and I have installed many of their different models of toilets for over 30 years with no problems. It would have scored five stars if the toilet had been more stylish.\n",

It was not smart height and it had a round front. It also didn't flush well at all. This unit on the other hand, is much nicer. It flushed well and with the elongated front, is much more comfortable to a man to use. The only carp is the hold down bolts are much too tall and the supplied caps don't cover them. Thus I had to use a hack saw to shorten the bolts so the decorative caps would work. The best solution would be to provide taller caps. The complete kit was a bonus and I installed it myself. It does not rock on my tile floor and has not leaked.\n",

I would give 5 stars but they left out the toilet seat bolts. I went to hardware store because it was closer and less hassle, but a complete set is supposed to be a complete set. The bolts I got from the hardware store don't exactly fit so I'll have to go get another set, more hassle. I recommend the toilet for the price 100%, just don't be surprised if you have to make a run to the store. Function is very good, wife says the power reminds her of a nice hotel toilet.\n",

I installed a taller toilet in my other bathroom for my daughter who is 4\" taller than me. Needed a lower one for myself. Super easy to install. The hardware, toilet seat and flush lever handle are pretty flimsy plastic but easy to replace. The bolt cap covers are not deep enough to snap over the bolt. I used an extra think wax ring but maybe i should have doubled up instead. Not sure if that would help but minor issue. Good quick flush for #1, hold down for #2...a bonus water saving feature I was not aware of.\n",

My wife is 5’7 and her feet do not lay flat on the floor. I have another comfort height toilet that is a little shorter. Toilet came with bolts and wax ring. Toilet works well after I loosened the flush handle. When I first installed the toilet it would stick in the flush position. I also added a slow close toilet lid.\n",

The build quality is flawless. From the soft closing lid to appease your significant other to the economical flushes, but still delivers maximum performance so there is no need to flush twice. The high perfect which I personally would call chair height. Easy on easy off. The elongated bowl is mor convenient than the traditional round bowl and accommodate more varying body types. The porcelain is perfectly finished with no sharp edges even where you will not be using. Even item needed for installation is provided except tool and labor. Instillation is pretty straight forward. One person can accomplish this on there own.\n",

The only tool I had available was a hacksaw blade, so this took a lot longer than expected. Only other complaint is that the seat attachment design and hardware seemed cheap compared to other seats I have installed (replacement seats). Overall, the toilet flushes great, installs according to typical instructions, and everything else went smoothly. The flush mechanism, handle, flap, and standpipe came preinstalled in the tank, with no issues or leaks. The toilet does NOT come with a hose to connect the tank to the wall water supply, as this is specific to each house, but make sure to note that if you are replacing a shorter bowl height toilet with this one, your existing supply line will likely be too short. You should replace it anyway. Overall this seems like a great replacement and includes a lot of value and convenience as a complete kit.\n",

Installation was very straight forward. The instructions said to tighten the three tank bolts two turns past hand tight. I did hand tight believing it was enough, but it seeped some. I did the two turns as called for and problem solved. The elongated design looks really good and sits quite comfortably. The tank plumbing worked great and no adjustment was needed. The seat was also an easy install. The flush is robust and cleans the bowl well. All the necessary hardware was included. The only downside is that the height seemed a little low for me; but I'm 6'5 tall. All in all, a very nice toilet that was easy to install, looks great good and works well.\n",

      "69     Made in USA, great product, very happy. Bought 2 for house with 3 toilets, wife primarily uses 2 of them so I wanted them to be the same so she wouldn't flop onto the shorter one. It is tall. You can read the other comments, I agree with them. So let me offer these suggestions. It is 95 pounds. I bought online so someone would deliver it to my car at Lowe's. At home, I opened the box in the driveway and carried it in two pieces rather than trying to lug a 95 pound box myself.The bottom is still heavy, hard on the back. New appreciation for plumbers. Regarding the flange bolts being too long, that is correct they need to be cut. After removing my current toilet and cleaning the area, I noticed those bolts were cut when installed originally in 1992. I reused them, no need to cut the ones that came with the toilet. The instructions talked about the waterline in the tank, which is not on the inside of the tank but on the white tube in the middle of the tank. Instructions say don't use galvanized hoses--they are not talking about the newer braided metal hoses, those are ok to use. If you don't crank the tank down, water will go all over when you flush, it is a bit different to use a socket on those 3 plastic nuts that hold the tank in place. Allow extra time for removal of the old one and cleaning up the area before the new installation. Removing the old one is just the reverse steps you will follow for the new installation, except you have to scoop out the water. In my case, the footprint of the old toilet was bigger than the new one, and I had to do some quick floor sanding and staining, sealing in two small places. I lined the area with paper towels to spot leaks for 3 days. Scraper tool helpful for old wax removal. Mansfield Customer Support called me back right away, I couldn't find the water line on the inside of the tank but when I was talking to the technician I saw it on that tube.\n",

Every bathroom time was frought with anxiety. Sometimes having to fetch a bucket of water to finish the job. Enter the Mansfield Pro-Fit 1. With its American made fully glazed siphon assist trap, this toilet will handle even the largest jobs with ease! Comes with every nut, bolt, seal and fastener required for installation. For the price of a mediocre night out you can also have this confidence inspiring flush in your life. Buy Mansfield and there'll be no regrets!

The instructions for installation were not clear, but even then I was happy with the purchase. The problem comes around two months after the purchase, every time we flush water goes for up to five to ten minutes, we have to manually arrange it. it is very disappointing.\n",

This was the only one that met those specific needs. I’ve never needed a toilet plunger before and had to run out to buy one. Unfortunately it gets used almost daily since the toilet gets clogged easily.\n",

It's at a point though where multiple people keep doing this and I'd have to put up a tacky sign telling people to press and hold to flush. No thank you. It has a weak flush and doesn't seem to flush all the way out. The handle is plastic and feels cheap. It's comfortable to sit on though and install was easy. I do prefer elongated and standard height (I'm 5'3\" so chair height doesn't let my feet fully touch the ground) but I will be returning this toilet for a different one. That's how annoying this flush is. I'm literally going to take this dang thing back for a different one.\n",

The tank upstairs is installed properly but leaks slightly at every flush. Not sure what the malfunction is with these toilets. Either a design flaw or manufacturing quality defect.\n",

Just purchased a second toilet to install today. This \"kit\" is also missing the flange nuts but more frustrating is the flange bolts are missing as well! I am not going to assume my old bolts are OK and I am not going to get the old toilet removed to find out then. It looks like I need to make another trip back into town, buy my own nuts and bolts along with using $10 in gas before I can start this project. I was happy to purchase something \"made in USA\" but I am very disappointed that the people packaging these so called \"kits\" can't do a better job.

It's not appealing to enter the bathroom and have to see fragments left on the side of the bowl from the person who used it before you. previous toilet was 40 years old and never had this problem Seems like the water line is not high enough to cleanse it when flushed or not enough water coming down all around the upper part to wash away debris.\n",

      "24     A toilet is a toilet. As long as it flushes with power and stuff goes down the drain without clogging it has done its job. However, not all toilet installs are created equal. I bought the toilet because its made in US and I figured it would be great quality. I didn’t check the reviews and I should have. This toilet has some QC issues and some included hardware is shoddy. The bolts holding down the tank were rubber pegs. It seemed ok at first but even tightened down they leaked. Also the holes between the base and the tank for the pegs were not alligned perfectly contributing to the leaking. I ended up installing the tank twice. The second time I put some wax from a left over wax ring around the peg and seated it in tank to water proof it. This resolved the leaking during the install. The second shoddy piece is the seat. Again the bolts didnt properly align with the holes in the base so I am not sure how long it will take before the hinges crack. Once installed the toilet does toilet things as you would expect. For installation save yourself the headache and go with a different brand.\n",

The screw that holds the lid on stripped after about a week and had to be replaced. Not a good toilet for the price.\n",
