"it,a a basic toilet the price is good easy to enstall"
"Everything you need is in this kit. The only other thing I bought was a supply line, but that is more dependent on your current plumbing. Instructions were clear to follow. Mounting the tank with the included three bolts worked well. There weren't any leaks like other reviews mentioned. Making sure all three bolts are tightened the same amount was key."
You can pay more but you not buy a better flushing toilet. Very good price for a comfort height toilet plus it comes with a close close toilet seat. Its great to be able to purchase a really solid product that is manufactured in the USA.
"Just received this toilet a few days ago so I have not installed it yet. But, I have opened the packaging and instructions and can tell this is a quality product as I have installed several toilets before. I especially like the fact that it comes with the seat and the wax ring included. Toilets are usually very easy to install so I do not anticipate any problems with the install."
"The Mansfield toilet we bought at Lowe’s fits perfectly in our small bathroom. It has the features we want (few do these days): standard, not chair height; and round bowl, not elongated. Also, it is priced much less than Kohler and other brands, yet is quality made in the USA. We're very happy with Mansfield!"
Fit perfectly in the spot. Flushs nicely. The only think i dont care for is the flush knob is plastic
Seems to to do what it is intended for. Comfortable seat..Not a lot of water in the bowl.
I liked that it was a taller toilet than my previous and great for my knees. The toilet uses less water.
"We installed it this week and it works well as the back bowl wall is almost straight down thus cleaning well. The seat and lid are thin plastic, and we wish they were as substantial as the ones on our 10-year-old Mansfield toilet. Are there options?"
"Install for the most part was fast and easy. Only two problems, and both were with the T bolts holding the toilet to the floor. First, the T bolts had a tendency to fall over when setting the bowl over them since there was nothing to hold them up. I used a small piece of cardboard pushed over them to hold them up. The next problem, and the bigger of the two, the T bolts were too long. The finishing caps wouldn't fit because the hit the end of the T bolts. Had to use a hack saw to cut them down to fit. Either supply longer caps to fit over the bolts, or supply shorter bolts."
"The Denali WaterSense Elongated Comfort Height 2-Piece Toilet came complete with everything needed to install, to include a new wax ring and slow close seat. The smartheight is ADA compliant which allows for easy sit and stand which helps with arthritic knees. The powerful flush only uses 1.28 gpf which saves on water usage while still emptying the bowl. The slow close seat is really slow, but at least it doesn’t slam shut. The tank fill is rather quiet and easy to adjust. All and all, I am happy with this toilet and am glad that I don’t have sit so low."
"Let me preface this article with how much I despise plumbing projects. This one was no exception, what should have been a two hour project took almost three times as long. First remove the old toilet only to find the flange is destroyed and will take ingenuity and lots of work. Many hours later I have the new flange and wax ring (provided with this toilet) in place ready for installation. This toilet bolted in very easily but I had to use plastic connector bolt different from the ones provided. These were recommended by a plumber when I was addressing the broken flange issue. I went to connect the toilet to the water supply but alas they did not provide that water line. Trying to reuse the old one it broke because part of it was plastic. It took three trips to Lowe’s to get the correct new shut-off valve and water fill line. Mostly my fault for not trying the connection at the store. The best part of this whole installation was the toilet itself, in the past I would have had to install the guts of the toilet myself adding time and expense. While this is only the third toilet I have ever installed it was by far the easiest. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to install a new toilet. I did spend a bit of time hunting for the plastic bolts for the seat, and finally decided to use the old ones figuring that they were not shipped or that I had misplaced them. After the new seat was installed I lifted the lid to conduct a test flush only to find the new plastic bolts taped conveniently to the underside of the lid."
"I only seemed to have some trouble because my plumbing is old and the flange was broken on both sides. But the toilet installed fairly well. I don't like how the tank connects to the bowl, The gap is really large."
This was a very easy install. Make sure that you have someone to help carry the box to the area of the install prior to unpacking if you can. All of the items were included for the install which saves time and trips for something that you may have forgotten. Be sure to clean the flange area prior to installing the new seal. I found that installing the bowl by itself without the tank was easier for me to handle. The tank was easy to attach. Be sure to not overtighten any of the fittings. Once ...
"Well packaged, reasonable price, easy to install, seat does not move, and toilet is sturdy. Solid waste flushes easily, but occasionally requires an extra flush to leave the bowl looking clean. I replaced my 3.6 GPF and would never be able to do a second flush without waiting for it to refill. This tank holds plenty of water so you to make that extra flush without waiting. Make sure to depress the handle completely to activate the refill valve. Of note, the seat is probably going to be a pain to clean the hinge area as its all open and dust and debris will undoubtedly collect."
Decided to replace my toilet in my garage. Got this one. Very easy to install. Directions were clear and easy to follow. Came with all the parts. Very comfortable. I love the gloss white finish. Flushes very well. Could definitely see myself replacing another with this same exact toilet. Would recommend to anyone
"Sleek, modern design compared to our decades old commode. Bought it online, picked it up shortly thereafter in the curbside pickup. Good price and great service from Lowe's. It's what they do!"
"Well built TOILET, but a cheap seat that does not stay tight. This makes it difficult to keep seat upright for those of us who stand up to be relieved. Everything is in the kit, and it flushes quickly and effectively without ""swirl"" effect. Be careful to select 10"" or 12"" (12"" is most common) and we chose the elongated a higher rise toilet..... what a nice difference over the 12-14"" high units with round bowl!"
Qualiry product. Just purchased ans installed this toilet for a new bath addition. Bought it becuase it was American-made and very price competitive. Instructions were easy to read ans follow. Will update over time if there are any issues.
"I read the reviews on how a lot of them said that it kept leaking through the rubber gaskets, I decided to buy this toilet because I needed a 10 inch rough in and it was the only one in stock that was elongated so i gave it a try. I had no leaks at all and it works great! I would have given it 5 stars but i did noticed that if you hold down handle a couple of seconds that you do get a better flush but works fine with quick flush. All in all the toilet looks great and it works well!"
This has to be the best toilet I’ve installed I have the previous vanquish model which I liked very much but this is better. It only takes one flush to clear the bowl which is fast and strong. It is easy to install everything is included except a wrench. The redesigned seat is a little tricky but worth the few extra minutes to install. Very simple to remove push a silver button and it lifts off to clean underneath then pop it back on the two pins and your done. When it is in the up position the seat fits into the lid with two little tabs to assist to open or close.
"Go with my bathroom, easy to put in. It's not leaking!"
"My husband and I purchased this toilet for my elderly parents. In our rush to make a purchase, as it was needed right away, we initially used google for a recommendation and purchased one made by Delta. Immediately, we noticed the water flow during flushing was poor. I called Delta and was told they were aware of the issue and that multiple flushes and frequent cleanings were recommended. So, I started doing some research to replace it. Mansfield Summit was the solution. Installation was standard and the flush was exactly what was expected; one flush for solids. My parents are very pleased. Cons, the seat that comes with it is poorly constructed, a disappointment. You will need to replace it. I’m not kidding, it’s that bad. Also, Mansfield packages their toilets upside down, so don’t be thrown off when you open the box. By the way, it is made in the USA. We were all very happy about that!"
"We are renovating a small half bath, and we needed to replace an old high-flow toilet. We chose the round bowl because of our limited space between the toilet and the vanity. This new toilet fits our small space and looks very good. The package included everything needed for a complete installation except the line from the water supply to the tank inlet. They really could not include that line because I needed to measure the distance to buy the correct line length. Everything was packaged compactly in an single box with lifting handles on the sides. An inner box contains the tank, tank cover, and instructions. I didn't notice that the cover was packed below the tank until after removing the tank from the box. The instructions were clear, and the installation was reasonable. It was easy to set the toilet square and level, and there were no leaks after following the instructions. Before trying this toilet, I had some general concern about the effectiveness of the low-flow operation, but this toilet appears to have a powerful flush. The tank is almost as large as the one on the old high-flow toilet, but the mechanism appears to meter less than half of the tank capacity for each flush. The weight of the remaining water provides more force for the limited water that is delivered in a flush. Each flush appears to clear the bowl completely, and we have not had any problems with it. This bowl height of this toilet is higher than the one that we replaced. Our consensus is that this height is more comfortable than the lower bowl, but I expect that is a matter of personal preference. This provided a good solution for our particular renovation need. It fits our small space, works well, and looks good."
"Seems heavy duty with a powerful flush. When flushing hold for additional second. I had a small blemish on the seat and contacted Summit. Summit Fed-Exed new one immediately. Another bonus, this brand is made in Ohio. "" American Standard "" is made in Thailand."
"The extra 3 inches in height being an ADA company toilet makes a big difference. I'm 6'1"" and it helps to not have to squat down so far. Toilet came with everything needed to install. It seems well built and looks great!"
"Base plumbing does not have tight angles, that means less clogs"
USA made product was easier to install than the American Standard toilet that had a broken tank lid in the bottom of its box. It is a water saver toilet whose flush is so powerful that it works cleanly and quietly.
I did not like the tank to bowl gasket seem very cheap made. I bought a different gasket to use and threw the other one away
I like that it has a strong flush and uses less water per flush. Very efficient.
Love the smaller reservoir tank and slow lowering seat. Wish the seat covered the entire commode. Easy to install. you have to hold down the lever to flush.
This toilet came with everything needed and ready to go. The tank is smaller so less water waste. The bowl is smooth and will be easy to clean. In stall was quick and easy came with everything needed except new water line. The plastic seat and lid seem a little to commercial so I will be replacing that. Comes with bees wax gasket to seal toilet to the flange in the floor. This toilet bowl has three holes at the tank attachment be careful not to over tighten here or were it mounts to the floor because it is Ceramic glass and will break if you apply too much torque pressure on the bolts and nuts. So be careful! All and all though this is a great toilet flushes good and is clean and white. I would recommend this product to you.
I love my new chair height toilet. I have bad hips and knees and I’m 74 years old. My regular height toilet was hard for me to set down on due to the height and after getting my new chair height toilet it’s so much easier to sit down and get back up. I truly love it❤️
"Good value for the money, easy to install and worth it"
"I liked the look of this toilet online and it works well for us. Others mentioned the loudness of the flush, and while it is louder than the old toilet we had I don't find it really loud. My tall husband didn't like the plastic toilet seat flexing, so we got a harder wooden toilet seat to replace the one that came with. Very happy with this toilet."
"Nice looking commode, installed easily. All parts were included except the line to connect the commode to the water supply. I purchased brass floor bolts to use instead of the steel ones supplied by the manufacturer, because they are rust-proof and were easier to saw off (both the original and the brass ones were too long). I like the forceful swirl-type flush. Time will tell if it is effective in cleaning the bowl well, but I expect it to. I also like that the toilet seat is a no-slam design. The push-button quick removal design of the toilet seat is also a nice hygienic touch. The old one had a hard to clean area under the hinge section."
"This is a nice looking, fairly easy to assemble toilet. It works well and comes with everything needed for installation and use except the toilet supply line (most toilets don't include that). Flushing pressure is very good but not great. It could be a little better. This toilet also sits pretty low. I am not sure if there is a higher / chair height available. Everything else is pretty standard and fits well. On the back of the tank lid there is a sticker with the names and serial numbers for all replacement parts which I have not seen on a toilet before and is a smart addition."
"Just installed this toilet today and it was an easy install. The tank to toilet securing bolts (3) have a nice hard rubber non-round head on them for easy gripping. Problem: The rubber head did not cover the bolt hole entirely, almost, but not quite. Consequently, it leaked pretty bad. I had them as tight as I could get them without cracking the toilet, but still leaked. I fussed for several hours including another trip to LOWES to fix the leak. After I got the leak under control, I appreciated how it flushed. Very nice. In my opinion, the tank mounting hardware needs rethinking, but I'm still buying a second one! I would give this toilet 5 stars easy if the tank mounting hardware worked."
"I am so glad I decided on this toilet. It was easy to install and had everything included. great price ,made in USA..and the flush is powerful .well worth $129"
We like this brand for our rentals. Lasts longer than American Standard.
Love the fact that everything you need is in the box.
"The seat is not very comfortable, but it flushes well."
"Be careful when installing to make sure the three bolts holding the tank to the base are tightened evenly, otherwise the thank will lean forward or backward and leak."
Toilet is good and easy to install problem was that the filler valve was defective ! After 2 flushes you have to tap because it will not fall so it will fill the tank. Was told by the lowes store where I bought it that they wouldn’t switch valves that I would have to return the whole unit ! But I was also told that Lowes will not accept a toilet once it’s been installed ! Figure that out ?
Gets the job done with power but at an affordable cost
They package this product upside down so The first one we bought had the tank flange destroyed. The exchanged it with out any problems but it delayed our install several days. Once installed the product worked great.
"Works well, easy to install, modest price. We replaced fancy-looking, expensive, hard to install and repair toilets with the Summit. Very glad we did."
"I’m extremely happy with this toilet, previous toilet was old and ugly with poor flushing. We had a Mansfield toilet installed downstairs a few years back and when we replaced the upstairs I wanted the same toilet. The newer one is even better."
Need professional help to install.after the person at Sam's write's up the order
Love the chair style feature and the extra flushing power. This was easy to install & is a great product!
Love the hight and change from our old color to fresh white has made a great improvement in our remodel of bathroom.
"VERY PLEASED, I LIKE THE SLEEK DESIGN AND IT FLUSHES VERY WELL."
"We installed this toilet to replace the chair height one that was in our spare bath when we got the house. The chair height is just too high in a bathroom used primarily by our younger kids (6+). Overall, this toilet is a toilet. I hit the flush lever and it flushes. That's what I need it to do and it does it well. Waste goes away when I hit flush...that's a win. For install, it went smoothly. Removed the old toilet, cleaned the old wax off the flange, then began installing the new toilet. I only have one criticism...the hardware kit that comes with the toilet doesn't have the nice little plastic washers to help hold the flange bolts up while you install the bowl. You can see in pic #3 where I used small pieces of cardboard to hold the bolts up. It works, but it wouldn't be too much to ask for Mansfield to include simple, cheap, thin plastic washers to hold the bolts up. Other than that, install was smooth. Got the bowl installed then put the tank on the back. After that, I connected the water feed, turned on the water, and checked for leaks...there were none! It was a smooth install and the toilet does exactly what a toilet should. The waste goes away and I know I have a quality toilet that is going to last!"
"Was very easy too install, didn’t even have to adjust the water fill. Has a powerful flush. I would recommend this too any do it yourselfer"
like the fact it works but slightly more than the competitor which I refuse to use ever again
"I had never heard of Mansfield before but rest assured this is as good a quality as any of the common names such as Kohler or American Standard. The removal of a 30+ year old round toilet and the installation of this higher, elongated commode was a relatively easy process. I removed all the old wax ring, used my Simple Green to clean the floor and followed the simple instructions. I did adjust the tank level to a lower setting. This is a fast flush unit that will give you two flush cycles on one tank of water. So it is indeed a much more efficient unit than the old one and I think better than our two which are less than five years old. Mansfield even packaged it with a slow close seat and lid....very nice."
I love the extra 2 to 3 inch heighth..I am a seni0r citizen...That extra heighth makes it much easier to get up from the toilet..
The product was easy to install as it came with everything needed to to the job
"Product was shipped to me directly from the factory. They called me and set up delivery. On the day of the delivery the driver called and gave me a 30 minute heads up, worked out great. Toilet took me about an hour to install myself and that included taking out the old one!!! So far so good. Nice made and finished."
Great add on to my home. Getting older and wanted a higher toilet.
Really good product and good bang for your buck recommend
took a couple of trips back to Lowe's to buy a jumbo toilet ring because my base was slightly recessed. Just thought I would be proactive. Took longer than I expected. But I am not the most skilled handyman around. However it works excellent and looks good. And best yet it is made in America!!!. Would recommend this Mansfield product
The Denali Elongated Comfort Height toilet is great! We had trouble finding a toilet that would fit in our bathroom because we have a baseboard for heat behind the toilet. We a so needed a toilet in bone because our new tub and sink are both bone. There are not many bone toilets available for purchase in any store. This toilet twas able to fit because it's base footprint is not as long behind the floor bolt as the majoy of toilets being sold. It has a nice powerful flush which is quieter than our previous toilet and uses less water. We love it!
My client was happy with the product and I was impressed with the ease of installation
"This is a good product with a powerful flush. I reduced it by one star because it only has two bolts holding the tank to the bowl. Since the toilet displays are mounted on the wall over 6 feet high, I was unable to see that at the time of purchase."
"This is a standard toilet, probably better suited for a smaller bathroom because of it's round bowl design. Easy to hook up. Everything you need is in the box, even the wax ring. Somewhat of a water saver due to it's smaller tank. Just a regular flapper design flush system. Works fine and a good value."
"Yesterday, I removed my old commode and installed the new Pro-Fit from Mansfield commode. The installation of the new commode was easy as the tank parts were already installed and they stayed in place and caused no trouble during the installation. Everything went in the proper place and I only had one tank bolt that caused a little leak at first. I kept adjusting until it stopped. The only reason I'm giving it a four is for two reasons. The toilet seat is a cheap version and probably won't last very long. The other reason is the toilet isn't tall enough. I think the tall version is 17 inches high (Not sure of that). As I'm now 77 years old and finding difficulty in getting up and down, I see this as a potential problem. But, overall, the commode is a good product and well worth what it sales for. I'm satisfied with it and would recommend it."
Pleasantly surprised everything came in the box new bolts. seat. wax ring really a quality product took about 30 minutes to install toilet has a super flush seems to be a little bit higher than the old one which is much nicer I would highly recommend this to anybody looking to upgrade to a new toilet Also really like the slow close seat no more banging
"I am now convinced that big box stores sell seconds. If you look at Lowes reviews of Mansfield, Kohler and American Standard you see many of the same quality problems. No wonder they sell for 1/2 of plumbing supply houses. In 8 hours at work my new toilet leaks half the contents of the bowl on my new floor. The toilet obviously has a crack or defect in the trap. I just ordered the same brand from a plumbing supply and when I asked the guy on the phone if the had many problems with that brand, he said ""none"". Coincidence?"
"This was the easiest replacement I have done. The Toilet comes with everything I needed to replace my existing toilet. The only tools required was a Crescent Wrench, Philip Screw driver and Pliers. i like how simple it was to adjust the water level, there a line on the fill tube. The instruction was easy to follow. Total time to remove and install was less than 2 Hours. Bidet seat will work on this toilet."
"Great toilet, looks good and it sits at a comfortable height."
Height was perfect. We had purchased another toilet but it was too tall. This one fit perfectly. Installation was easy.
Best product we could find in the area. The anti-stain glazing will make a big difference.
"This is a solid toilet, comes with everything you need. It installs very quickly, make sure to tighten all the bolts slowly you don't want to crack anything. The bolts for the back tank are easy and the seat installs with a screwdriver. We Replaced the smaller toilet that originally came in the basement. The elongated bowl and the higher seat makes this a all around nice upgrade."
"Toilet works great although the flush is a bit odd; press flush handle quickly for light flush or hold 2-3 seconds for full flush. So, it's a dual-flush without the extra cost...? Installation went surprisingly well for being my first toilet installation ever. Manufacturer provides clear instructions that made it easy, although I must say it was disconcerting to read, paraphrasing, ""Tighten all three tank-to-bowl nuts, fill tank, and check for leaks. If it leaks, tighten them each 1/2 turn and recheck."" Hmmm. Mine did not leak at all, so I'm satisfied overall."
The toilet itself looks nice. Has a sleek design that elevates the look of the bathroom. Install is simple and comes with all the parts you need. The slow close lid is nice that it’s not loud when shut. I have a couple kids and am constantly asking them not to slam the lid. Nice that it’s not possible now. That said the lid (not the seat) is a little flimsy and I’m not able to sit on it without it bending in. I don’t think it’ll break but I also won’t be testing it. I also found the water refilling noise to be quite loud. I did turn the water down from fully open and that did eliminate it. Good to note if you have higher home water pressure. Other then that it’s been working great. If you’re looking to update the look of an older bathroom this could be a good fit.
"Love this toilet, it sits a little high but it has a powerful fast flush."
The bowl and seat size is perfect for my height. In addition you don’t have to flush multiple times. Awesome in saving water consumption.
Toliet was easy to install and was a great price. Would buy again.
"This came with everything in the box, including the seat! Nice style and everything that you need to install it, the only thing that I found difficult were the instructions! The top tank leaked a little when I installed it but it was soon taken care of! The large nut that holds the inside together was loose, a simple tightening and I was set! Great value and super quiet. Only takes a minute to refill after flushing!"
"Just purchased & installed Denali in bone color ar my parents house. It replaced an older,lower 1 piece kohler unit. I wanted to do an American Standard, but none were available in bone/off white & elongated, chair height at my local Lowe's. Other option was a Kohler model, but it had some fancy piston flushing valve system. Saw this Mansfield Denali unit, simple fluid master flush system, reviews looked good, made in USA. So gave it a shot. Packaged extremely well, nothing broke, damaged etc. Quick easy directions Installed real nice & looks great. Flushes like a champ Really glad I gave it a shot"
"Everything was fine except the engineering aspect. The closet has 3 bolts that fixes it to the bowl. 2/3 were hard to reach and if you do not tighten them down equally, the closet will not be level. All other aspects of this toilet were OK"
"Overall, I'm really happy with this fixture. I chose this over similar models from the other names because it is American made and nicely priced. I like the 3"" rigid flapper with replaceable silicone rubber seal a lot. It closes with a slight bang, but the flush is amazingly powerful, especially considering the efficiency. I think a softer rubber universal replacement flapper would make it quieter, but in my powder room, the noise is no issue. I like that it has 3 tank bolts instead of 2. The patented bolt design is strange, but I still like it better than Kohler's 3-bolt/funky seal design. There is no need for lots of torque, but you must be methodical in tightening them. Do it gradually in an alternating pattern like with lug nuts. The documentation indicates the correct order. I learned if you rush that step, it will leak. Look out for stray bits of loose glazing in the tank box and make sure there are none in the fill valve before connecting the supply. The pre-assembled tank components required no adjustments at all. The seat seems cheap, but it will do the job until it breaks."
"Complete comes with fluid master fill and flush valve, seat is included with quick release buttons for easy cleaning. Side mounted chrome trip lever to flush the toilet."
"I like the design of this toilet. It sets back in front so it was great for our one tiny bathroom. (We purchased two toilets) Both had more room behind them and I like having more room to clean therel. The tank is smaller and fit right next to the wall. One of our previous toilets had set several inches away from the wall. The design on the outside looks like it will be easier to clean and keep clean as well. The flush sounds strong and seems to rinse the toilet bowl well. The flush is loud and makes a pretty good 'thunk' as the stopper drops in place. The chain needed adjusting and one of them broke as it was so thin. The flushing handle seems cheap and flimsy. The slow-close seats are plastic, very lightweight, take forever to close, and keep coming loose. We will be replacing them. The money we spent seemed to be in the china parts of these toilets. The lightweight chain, flimsy feeling flushing handle and cheap lightweight seats were disappointing."
"This is a great package deal. Everything you need between your water supply line and your toilet flange in the floor. ADA compliant ""comfort"" height makes getting up and down significantly easier for older people, people with disabilities, or people with arthritis and general mobility issues. This toilet has very nice finishes. Love the snap on, quick release toilet seat, which will make cleaning way easier too. Can't ask for anything more."
"What I wanted. See if helps water bill, Now have two in house. I had one put in upstairs last month."
Flushes very well. I used our old seat though. The one that comes with this is a low quality. Our previous soft close toilet seat is actually made by this company it's just much sturdier.
"All parts were there; no broken parts, very easy to install with great written instructions."
"Likes: Mansfield customer service was awesome. I called and spoke with them twice while deciding on purchasing this and they were very helpful. It's pretty (no logos on it anywhere, my wife likes handle on the side) and is solidly built/heavy. The flush is very strong when you hold the handle down (see dislikes) and it has anti-stick coating like other higher-end brand toilets. I chose it over similar American Standard (Champion) and Kohler (Cimmaron) toilets available at Lowes because these toilets have serious quality control issues (cracking and issues with flush valves, respectively). I did NOT use the included wax ring but instead used the Danco 4.75-in Toilet Wax Ring with Bolts Item #: 3844101 Model #: 10826X which I highly recommend as this allows you to reposition toilet if needed and it's a very secure fit on this toilet. Dislikes: You must hold the handle down to get a good flush. I talked to Mansfield about this and it's the way it's designed. The flapper they have doesn't float at all. I have purchased a new flapper to try from HomeDepot (Fluidmaster Universal 3 in. Premium Adjustable Toilet Flapper) that I'm hoping will allow for a good flush without holding the handle down. The flush is loud and the flapper slams down hard if you don't hold the handle down long enough. Also, it takes a long time for the tank to fill after flushing and it's louder than our previous toilet-most of the water goes into the bowl and not the tank. My wife feels the toilet sits a little high, but I'm fine with it-we're the same height so personal preference. Overall I'm pretty happy with the toilet and was VERY impressed with Mansfield's customer service. I had a hard time finding any information about this toilet before I bought, so I'm hoping this review helps other people decide on it."
I just In installed this unit. it looks good .but had trouble with the 2 bolt 🔩 tank set up. lot trouble stopping leaking between boll & tank still don't know if it stop compellingly have wate a few days to make sure
It works. Needs to flush longer at the beginning. Stops when you let go of the handle.
"Forty years as a plumber, this is the best toilet for the money."
This product flushes great. Installed quickly and easily.
The toilet basin is fine. The enclosed seat is the worst kind of basic plastic.
"Everything was in the box, well packaged. Installation was fairly easy, I had a little trouble getting the tank to bowl connection to not leak, but just wasn't tightening the plastic nuts enough. So far it is flushing well, not plugging. Overall I'm happy with this toilet."
First offered off the shelf was an open box. Wax ring was used. Lid busted. Why put it back in stock? Second one. Checked it out. In tact. Started install and realized the tank mounting hardware was gone. Ran to Lowes and they yanked it from the busted unit. All good. Then during tank install I noticed a casting imperfection that those sketchy looking mount bolts would likely not seal. Gorilla sealant on hand I shot that on the mating faces. Here's to hop because I need this toilet up to finish the flooring in another bathroom. Will have to think about the toilet for the next room. I will say the employee was very helpful to sort this out easily
It a great look toilet. It flushes everything in one flash. Everything is included wax ring and mounting bolts. The stuff in the tank is preassembled which allow an easy installation. I would recommend this toilet for anyone.
Easy to assemble and install. No leaking issues at all. I would recommend this.
"These are very stable, good looking toilets with a very good flush."
"Flushes well for the price. Has a weight on the chain so if you just need a quick flush, it stops it quick. Need a longer one, just hold it for an extra second."
"Good solid toilet, with duel flushing ability. Quick flush for liquid, use less water, with a stronger flush for solids. Easy to install, includes wax ring, mounting bolts, bolt covers. The seat could be a little heavier, but it works OK."
"Very nice. Quiet flush. Adjustable full valve is a nice feature. I did replace the seat though, simply because I prefer a wooden seat. Great product! I recommend this one!"
"First, I was appalled that ""American Standard"" toilets are made in Mexico! Denali are made in Ohio, by a company founded in the 1920's that employs hundreds of people in a small town. The Denai toilet if very well made, with a very powerful flush as promised! My plumber had little trouble installing it. Should anything go wrong inside, it should be easy to fix. The price was only about twenty dollars more than ""American Standard""'s equivalent model. I am happy to pay just a bit more to support American workers and Made in U.S.A. products."
"Kind of hard to get excited about a toilet, but the install on this was a breeze. Instructions were simple and the rubber-headed tank bolts create a great seal. That said, a few things to keep in mind: 1. Buy an extra wax ring. If you’ve had a remodel that includes granite or marble flooring, odds are good the supplied ring won’t be thick enough to create a good seal. Having a second ring will allow you to double the depth. Wax rings run about $2.00, so go ahead and splurge—it could save you a trip back to the store; 2. When attaching the tank, you’ll need to stretch the rubber gasket a bit to seat it flush to the bottom of the tank. The instructions are a bit vague on that, and you’ll be going through a couple of towels if you don’t! The toilet itself is pretty good. The oblong shape is far more comfortable than traditional round bowls. A quick flick of the handle drains about half the tank (thereby conserving water) and holding the handle down will completely drain it (for when a little more oomph is needed). What I like best is that the tank is very quiet when refilling. All said, a good product that’s easy to install."
This is a very nice toilet setup. The two piece (bowl & tank) seem to be made very well. Unlike other toilets I have purchased this one comes with everything needed included the wax ring. All plumbing inside the tank pre-assembled to help speed up the installation process.
Very easy to install and gives my bathroom anew look
All in all the toilets were installed properly one tank had a crack and you guys replaced it with no problems. This was a very smooth and good outcome. We are very pleased with these new toilets. Thank you.
Was easy to install and came with everything that was needed.
"nice height, good flush. terrible seat, you will want to replace the seat"
"Replaced a toilet in our powder room and didn't want to spend a fortune and I didn't need anything fancy. This was a good choice. The one I Replaced was 14 1/2"" high to the top of bowl. This was an inch higher an that was fine."
For a DIY type person this was very easy to install. Having everything needed in the box for install is great. The toilet seat is kind of cheap and thin and doesn't feel overly durable. I'd you've never installed a toilet using the directions in reverse to remove the existing toilet is extremely helpful. The tank bolts having built in gaskets was amazing and made it very easy to seat the tank and not worry that it was going to leak. Very happy with this product overall.
"Pretty nice toilet! Easy to install, especially if you've done one before. Even if you haven't, it's still easy, since all the tank parts are already installed. This is the comfort height, so it's more suitable for taller people. I'm 5'5"", but it is in a bathroom that belongs to someone taller then me! Everything you need is included."
Never have to plunge again. Powerful flush. Good hight if you ever get injured and have a hard time getting up.
"Today I installed this toilet in my home and retired my 40+ year old commode. first the box and its contents are very well constructed,the box had cutouts that made handling this toilet very easy so I could move it around the house till I was ready to install. The toilet itself is very solid and well constructed it included the wax ring and all hardware needed to put this together in about 30 minutes. the Tank mounted really solid and I didn't have to crank down on the nuts to get it to seal. My..."
"Good quality , flushes nicely, handle doesn’t feel cheap"
"Easy to assemble, does the job, nice looking. Not the highest quality parts (plastic). The seat cover is a bit warped, but not a deal breaker."
"The only thing that I had to put together was the tank, and it was easy to install after that"
"I bought two of the Mansfield Vanquish 2 toilets and am very satisfied. My pickup experience was fine. My plumber installed them easily and quickly. I was replacing old, round bowl, low-to-the-floor toilets. I love the elongated bowl and, as a tall person, I especially love the chair height. These toilets have a strong jet rinse and slow-closing seats that do not make a slamming sound. They seem to be easy to keep nice and clean. You do have to hold the flush handle down for a half a second instead of letting go immediately but that's not really an issue. I hate to admit it but I was so excited to get these new toilets and I am not disappointed."
This toilet is perfect for our half bath. The flush is superb. Takes care of removing everything and leaves nothing unwanted behind. This is the 2nd toilet in our home. We love the great flushing and low water usage on this toilet. Would definitely buy again.
"My husband picked this toilet out, it is hard to find a toilet that is comfortable for a 6’5” person and this one works for him!"
"I liked the packaging, the quality of the product, and the ease of installation"
"This is a great upgrade and very nice that it sits so much higher than old one. I had a plumber install, and he said it was very easy, no problems at. He didn't really like the way the tank sat on the bowl, but there has been no problems with it at all. I really like the quick flush, and only have to hold down if needing to do a full flush.Have only had in installed for one week."
Product has excellent quality and was price competitive
Easy to install standard height toilet at a reasonable price
"To me, this is the best value on the shelves at Lowe's. Solid, made-in-USA product with Fluidmaster internals means it's going to last. I replaced a 20-year-old Crane toilet and the process was seamless. I was admittedly a bit leery about the ""smart fastener"" tank-to-bowl fasteners, but they worked as advertised. Although this unit comes with all needed parts, I used the Fluidmaster wax-free base seal, which mated perfectly to this unit. I would definitely buy this unit again -- and it's only a few bucks more than the Chinese-made budget models."
"THE GOOD: Nice looking, good price, Fluid Master fill valve, toilet tank wax seal & hardware is included. The toilet has a large jet at the bottom that helps push waste to the drain (see photo). THE NEUTRAL: The flapper has a unique design as the hole on one side is larger than the hole on the other side. Not a big deal as Lowe's sells the Mansfield flapper (item # 4133941). If you care to upgrade to a better flapper, you will greatly increase your flush performance (Lowe's item # 4133941), see photo. The Fluid Master fill valve comes with a flow restrictor which means that it takes a long time to refill the tank after each flush. Instructions for removing the flow restrictor can be found my Googling ""How to remove the toilet fill valve regulator."" COULD BE BETTER: There are no rubber washers or spacers used to level & support the tank as you secure it to the toilet. After failing to get a good seal, I placed 3 tank toilet washers on top of each of the 3 holes on the toilet, then I placed the tank on the toilet (see photo). The Lowe's item # on the tank washers is 3625389. The tank was immediately level and stable, and the seal was perfect. Overall the Mansfield toilet is a quality product at a good price. If you add the rubber tank washers as spacers, you don't have to worry about porcelain to porcelain contact as the tank to toilet washer is compressed by the weight of the water in the tank. As stated, you can upgrade to the other brand flapper and greatly improve your flush performance."
"Excellent, high quality toilet. I notice immediately it was much heavier that the Kol toilet it was replacing. Nothing cheap about it. Guts are standard flowmaster, nothing fancy but solid stuff. Packaged perfect, parts in individual boxes with good instructions. Delivery was delayed but it's holiday time so not a problem. Easy installation for most part. Toilet mount bolts were too short for my tiled floor. Had to purchase 3.5 lag bolts, no big deal. Toilet water bowl is the 2 bolt mount. No issue with leaks, bolted up nice, however still has a little tilt forward so I shimmed tank with small piece of plastic shim to level it out. Toilet seat self closing- First time I ever had to look at instructions to mount a toilet seat! Probably took longer to mount seat that the complete toilet. Didn't help that my wife was watching and wanted it perfectly line up! Very satisfied with this toilet. No leaks, straight forward install. Very quiet operation. Flushes well and cleans up easy. Wife says it looks very high standard compared to contractor grade toilets. Much happier now with the lever flush than the center top lid push button on other toilet."
Relatively easy to install Balancing tank most difficult
"We have been very pleased with this toilet. strong quick flush. no leaks, not hard to install. my only criticism is the tank lid is not flat. there's a slight raised hump in the middle. anything you put on the lid either slides forward or backwards."
I like the height of the toliet.
"This was a major improvement to an older toilet, but I do not like the plastic seat, which I will replace."
The toilet unit is of good quality and came with a toilet seat and everything else needed for installation. The ADA compliant height is very comfortable and glad I made the investment to upgrade. The price point was reasonable compared to similar units on the market.
I'm extremely happy with this size and fit of this toilet.
"I liked the highs, and the flush was exceptional!!"
"Mansfield pro-fit toilet is great and USA made and toilet package comes with it wax ,bolts,instructions everything you need to install it’s a easy step by step install great product, water consumption is 1.28gpf which is great ."
Grateful for the 10 inch rough-in. Saved me hundreds of dollars if pipe needed to be moved.
"Color was slightly darker than I was expecting. The sink and tub were a shade and a half lighter, but it’s not an extreme difference."
"This item is just what I needed to replace the existing stool. The existing stool was small and round and short. A real pain for a handicapped person, but this new stool with be a great comfort."
A toilet is a toilet pretty much. Good things about this toilet is it’s powerful flush. Toilet looks and installs just like all the others. I see no difference appearance wise compared to other brands. Box is a complete toilet install kit with everything. Install was easy. Typical install directions
Very easy to install and it looks great. I liked it so much I bought another for my upstairs bathroom.
"We've had this toilet for a couple of weeks now. It is working fine and the flushing action is very powerful. Don't know how it works, but when you flush it sounds like water is being pushed in with force and sucked out as well. When we installed it, the tank bolts didn't line-up perfectly with the bowl so when we thought everything was ready to test, it leaked a little at one of the bolts. Loosening the bolt and wiggling a little resolved the problem and there has been no problem since then. If we decide to replace our remaining chair height toilet with a comfort height one, we will buy this one again."
"Everything is fine so far, except the provided tank flapper is so heavy that it reseats immediately. Because of that the tank only slightly empties, unless you stand there and hold the lever down. I’m going to replace all the tank parts to get around this ridiculous oversight. Would Not have purchased this model if I had known about this!"
"This is, by far, the easiest toilet I have ever installed!"
"I don't like tall toilets, which is what we had in our mudroom bathroom. Decided it was time to bite the bullet and replace it with a lower one. Wasn't looking forward to the job, but this Mansfield Pro-Fit Standard Height was really easy to install. It came with everything you need to finish the job. No need to go back to the store (as usual) to get parts that you don't have. The attachment screws, nuts, etc. worked well. Especially appreciated the ease of attached the top section. No l..."
"Our plumber recommended this toilet because it has the 3-bolt tank to bowl system. The height is perfect, and although the lid did feel a more narrow… I still give it a 5. Normally you wouldn’t be there for very long so it wasn’t a dealbreaker (right?)."
The toilet is very attractive and has a strong flush. All waste is removed with one flush. The seat is soft-close and recessed into the lif which is a nice look. The seat also has a quick release button for easy cleaning. The flush is a little louder than other toilets but not terrible. The only negative is that i had to replace the flush valve as the toilet leaked continually. Even after several attempts at reinstalling. Not a big deL since the part is cheap and easy to awap ou.
"As stated in other reviews, this toilet has a strong flush. Because we are a commercial operation, we opted to adjust the float downward to allow more water per flush. It is done easily by removing the plastic keeper from the chain and moving the float to a lower position and reinstalling the keeper. Overall, a very nice toilet. We have installed many in our facilities and haven't had any problems at all. The included seats are plastic, they work fine but are not as sturdy as solid seats. note: Be careful not to overtighten the mounting bolts, they will break."
"This is a very stylish toilet. The kit is complete from the floor up ( except for the connecting water line). When I received the box it was very well packaged with adequate amounts of heavy duty triple wall corrugated box and other packing material as needed. The kit is complete with the toilet base, the toilet tank, the float and valve assembly for inside the tank and the toilet seat as well as all the hardware needed and the wax ring. The included instructions are complete and straightforward. The toilet complete setup job only took me about 30 minutes once I had removed my old one. I really like the classic modern design and it blended well with the white porcelain tub and sink and the chrome hardware on same. I certainly give this a thumbs up."
My husband installed ours last evening and he had no issues. Went very smoothly. We like the fact that it sits higher than our old one. That and the slow close lid were 2 things we were looking for when we chose which toilet we were going to buy. Our only complaint is the seat/lid is very cheaply made. We’ll be going back to the store and buying a new seat for it. Otherwise I’d have given it 5 stars.
Good price for a toilet and it was perfect for the project I needed it for
"I am 5'8"" tall and my sweetheart is 6'4"". I selected this toilet as a replacement for the top flushing toilet my youngest was having problem pushing the button. The toilet is too short for us at our height, but worked perfectly and installed quickly. We kept it for 4 days before my knees complained. Now, I just let him handle things, I was trying to help, but this toilet is perfect for children or those who are closer to the floor. Not for tall people at all. Good look, sturdy."
"When I got the toilet, was thinking it is no different than any other, but after getting it installed it was apparent that it’s better. It stands a little higher making it much easier to get off of and is built heavy duty making it sit firm in place while installing and using. Had everything I needed for the install. This is a gorgeous looking toilet."
"The first thing I want to say is if you've ever stayed at a hotel and used their toilets, and they almost suck you in when you flush, well that is exactly how this toilet works. Scared me the first time I flushed it. It comes with easy to install instructions which is a plus, all the hardware you need to install the toilet minus your water supply line comes in the box. I do not care for the toilet seat that accompanies this system. I feel that the seat is cheap and the hole in which you use is too small. I am not a large person and it still feels uncomfortable, and the screws that come with it to install the seat are extremely long, could definitely use shorter screws and metal not plastic would be nice. Also when installing the tank to the base, you might want to have a 17mm socket available to help tighten down the bowl. Once the toilet is in place, you only have a few inches from the wall to try and secure the screws provided. I used a 17mm socket to help secure the nuts to the bolts. Overall since I just installed this last night, I do like this product and think with a few minor changes it would be the perfect product."
"The packaging of this unit is exceptional. This was ship to be common carrier and the outside of the box was a little messed up. However, when I open the box all the components were completely intact. No breakage or scratches. This one is a comfort height or chair height. It is approximately17” from the floor to the top of the bowl with the seat up. The quality is apparent right out of the box. The internal flush valve and flapper are quality. The unit is quiet and refill is quick. I am sure this will last a least 40 years or more which is way past my lifetime. Looking for a new quality quiet toilet? Look no further. BUY IT."
Beautiful! No longer have issues getting up from a low toilet. I have bad knees and would have to rock to get up or support using the sink pantry. The 33” was the tallest toilet I could find at Lowes. It was a never product that I could buy.
"I highly recommend attaching the tank to the bowl before setting the bowl to the ground. The tank connects to the bowl with three screws instead of the standard two, with one in the back. This nut is almost impossible to tighten once the bowl is attached to the ground, putting this nut against the wall."
This is a very nice toilet and sleek design. Flushes well.
Great power on the flush side . Definitely would use this brand again
"Awesomeness in a toilet , sounds funny but it is true. The quick release seat is a really unique idea and makes cleaning so much easier just like the way it flushes , the swirling when it flushes cleans the bowl so much more efficiently"
"Good replacement toilet from the old worn out one we had. It flushes great- lots of power-It's a bit smaller than most, so anyone taller should pass on this one- but great for kids!"
"The ""chair height"" feature is way more comfortable for me as I am getting farther and farther into my senior years; plus I love the more modern design and more robust flushing features. Hopefully I can throw my plunger away."
"I needed a new toilet with a 10 inch rough in on a Sunday, I was concerned this was not a big name, but am happy with the purchase, installed easily, still ""tuning"" the float to make it flush just right, but if you are on the fence with this one, its a good toilet."
Was easy to install. Only needed a pair of channel locks and a flat head screwdriver.
Decent toilet for spaces that do not allow the standard in the space like old building apartments.
"The best description for this model falls under your basic no-frills commercial-style dependable toilet, nothing fancy. This toilet is not the fanciest design-wise but it is user-friendly and plumber-friendly. You will always find replacement flappers or fill valves down the road when they need to be replaced. Mansfield is a reputable company, and I have installed many of their different models of toilets for over 30 years with no problems. It would have scored five stars if the toilet had been more stylish."
"I purchased this to replace a contractor installed Project Source unit that I had for over 6 years. It was not smart height and it had a round front. It also didn't flush well at all. This unit on the other hand, is much nicer. It flushed well and with the elongated front, is much more comfortable to a man to use. The only carp is the hold down bolts are much too tall and the supplied caps don't cover them. Thus I had to use a hack saw to shorten the bolts so the decorative caps would work. The best solution would be to provide taller caps. The complete kit was a bonus and I installed it myself. It does not rock on my tile floor and has not leaked."
Needed a new toilet. This toilet was an easy installation with everything included. The only thing I would improve on is a better seat.
There was a couple things that confused me. The silicone that was in the commode.I have included pictures. I remove silicone from the bootom because of concern that waste might get caught. Over all every thing works well. The dual flush function works well. So far so good.
GOOD price and included toilet seat was an added bonus.
"For a value toilet, it's really a nice looking toilet. I would give 5 stars but they left out the toilet seat bolts. I went to hardware store because it was closer and less hassle, but a complete set is supposed to be a complete set. The bolts I got from the hardware store don't exactly fit so I'll have to go get another set, more hassle. I recommend the toilet for the price 100%, just don't be surprised if you have to make a run to the store. Function is very good, wife says the power reminds her of a nice hotel toilet."
"I was looking for a no frills toilet to replace my original '80s toilet that used way too much water per flush. I installed a taller toilet in my other bathroom for my daughter who is 4"" taller than me. Needed a lower one for myself. Super easy to install. The hardware, toilet seat and flush lever handle are pretty flimsy plastic but easy to replace. The bolt cap covers are not deep enough to snap over the bolt. I used an extra think wax ring but maybe i should have doubled up instead. Not sure if that would help but minor issue. Good quick flush for #1, hold down for #2...a bonus water saving feature I was not aware of."
It fits into a compact area and it is compatible with my bathroom decor.
This ada compliant toilet is pretty tall. My wife is 5’7 and her feet do not lay flat on the floor. I have another comfort height toilet that is a little shorter. Toilet came with bolts and wax ring. Toilet works well after I loosened the flush handle. When I first installed the toilet it would stick in the flush position. I also added a slow close toilet lid.
"You get what you pay for and Denali has always been synonymous with top quality and the Toilet has delivery completely. The build quality is flawless. From the soft closing lid to appease your significant other to the economical flushes, but still delivers maximum performance so there is no need to flush twice. The high perfect which I personally would call chair height. Easy on easy off. The elongated bowl is mor convenient than the traditional round bowl and accommodate more varying body types. The porcelain is perfectly finished with no sharp edges even where you will not be using. Even item needed for installation is provided except tool and labor. Instillation is pretty straight forward. One person can accomplish this on there own."
Cheap seat/lid
"Install went mostly according to plan, however the bolts to secure the toilet to the floor were too long and had to be cut. The only tool I had available was a hacksaw blade, so this took a lot longer than expected. Only other complaint is that the seat attachment design and hardware seemed cheap compared to other seats I have installed (replacement seats). Overall, the toilet flushes great, installs according to typical instructions, and everything else went smoothly. The flush mechanism, handle, flap, and standpipe came preinstalled in the tank, with no issues or leaks. The toilet does NOT come with a hose to connect the tank to the wall water supply, as this is specific to each house, but make sure to note that if you are replacing a shorter bowl height toilet with this one, your existing supply line will likely be too short. You should replace it anyway. Overall this seems like a great replacement and includes a lot of value and convenience as a complete kit."
"First off, the toilet had easy to read instructions in the box and on the box. Installation was very straight forward. The instructions said to tighten the three tank bolts two turns past hand tight. I did hand tight believing it was enough, but it seeped some. I did the two turns as called for and problem solved. The elongated design looks really good and sits quite comfortably. The tank plumbing worked great and no adjustment was needed. The seat was also an easy install. The flush is robust and cleans the bowl well. All the necessary hardware was included. The only downside is that the height seemed a little low for me; but I'm 6'5 tall. All in all, a very nice toilet that was easy to install, looks great good and works well."
Everything needed to install toilet included. Previous Mansfield toilet very reliable.
I love the comfort height! The only thing I don't like is the quality of the seat. I'll have to replace it soon.
"When we remodeled our bathroom, our toilet was off white colored. This toilet is pure white and elongated. It has a soft closed lid. It was easy to install and comes with everything needed."
"Made in the USA, good quality. Very happy with the product, looks nice and easy to install. Will buy again."
Nothing fancy but it does the job and my wife really likes it. Looks like it has standard internals that can be found at the hardware store when needed. Works fine
"Made in USA, great product, very happy. Bought 2 for house with 3 toilets, wife primarily uses 2 of them so I wanted them to be the same so she wouldn't flop onto the shorter one. It is tall. You can read the other comments, I agree with them. So let me offer these suggestions. It is 95 pounds. I bought online so someone would deliver it to my car at Lowe's. At home, I opened the box in the driveway and carried it in two pieces rather than trying to lug a 95 pound box myself.The bottom is still heavy, hard on the back. New appreciation for plumbers. Regarding the flange bolts being too long, that is correct they need to be cut. After removing my current toilet and cleaning the area, I noticed those bolts were cut when installed originally in 1992. I reused them, no need to cut the ones that came with the toilet. The instructions talked about the waterline in the tank, which is not on the inside of the tank but on the white tube in the middle of the tank. Instructions say don't use galvanized hoses--they are not talking about the newer braided metal hoses, those are ok to use. If you don't crank the tank down, water will go all over when you flush, it is a bit different to use a socket on those 3 plastic nuts that hold the tank in place. Allow extra time for removal of the old one and cleaning up the area before the new installation. Removing the old one is just the reverse steps you will follow for the new installation, except you have to scoop out the water. In my case, the footprint of the old toilet was bigger than the new one, and I had to do some quick floor sanding and staining, sealing in two small places. I lined the area with paper towels to spot leaks for 3 days. Scraper tool helpful for old wax removal. Mansfield Customer Support called me back right away, I couldn't find the water line on the inside of the tank but when I was talking to the technician I saw it on that tube."
"I got tired of my 80s American Standard ""quiet flush"" toilet with its embarassing useless flush. Every bathroom time was frought with anxiety. Sometimes having to fetch a bucket of water to finish the job. Enter the Mansfield Pro-Fit 1. With its American made fully glazed siphon assist trap, this toilet will handle even the largest jobs with ease! Comes with every nut, bolt, seal and fastener required for installation. For the price of a mediocre night out you can also have this confidence inspiring flush in your life. Buy Mansfield and there'll be no regrets! Here's a video of the flush. https://youtube.com/shorts/E1gmvF5a6iI?feature=share"
It’s totally amazing perfect for my miniature bathroom. It’s styilish and looks amazing with my chunky white walls. Beautiful. 4\5 it’s thick and long enough and the hole is perfect so the water don’t splash when I do bowel movements. It’s also thunkly sizeable and encourages me to flush the toilet more.
I like that the trap and outlet size are big enough to not get clogged so easily.
I love the higher seat and the color. Also the slow closing seat is great!
The price point was good and since it came in two pieces (bowl and tank) it was easier to install.
