The only tool I had available was a hacksaw blade, so this took a lot longer than expected. Only other complaint is that the seat attachment design and hardware seemed cheap compared to other seats I have installed (replacement seats). Overall, the toilet flushes great, installs according to typical instructions, and everything else went smoothly. The flush mechanism, handle, flap, and standpipe came preinstalled in the tank, with no issues or leaks. The toilet does NOT come with a hose to connect the tank to the wall water supply, as this is specific to each house, but make sure to note that if you are replacing a shorter bowl height toilet with this one, your existing supply line will likely be too short. You should replace it anyway. Overall this seems like a great replacement and includes a lot of value and convenience as a complete kit.",5,13,2

Scared me the first time I flushed it. It comes with easy to install instructions which is a plus, all the hardware you need to install the toilet minus your water supply line comes in the box. I do not care for the toilet seat that accompanies this system. I feel that the seat is cheap and the hole in which you use is too small. I am not a large person and it still feels uncomfortable, and the screws that come with it to install the seat are extremely long, could definitely use shorter screws and metal not plastic would be nice. Also when installing the tank to the base, you might want to have a 17mm socket available to help tighten down the bowl. Once the toilet is in place, you only have a few inches from the wall to try and secure the screws provided. I used a 17mm socket to help secure the nuts to the bolts. Overall since I just installed this last night, I do like this product and think with a few minor changes it would be the perfect product.",4,10,1

We chose the round bowl because of our limited space between the toilet and the vanity. This new toilet fits our small space and looks very good. The package included everything needed for a complete installation except the line from the water supply to the tank inlet. They really could not include that line because I needed to measure the distance to buy the correct line length. Everything was packaged compactly in an single box with lifting handles on the sides. An inner box contains the tank, tank cover, and instructions. I didn't notice that the cover was packed below the tank until after removing the tank from the box. The instructions were clear, and the installation was reasonable. It was easy to set the toilet square and level, and there were no leaks after following the instructions. Before trying this toilet, I had some general concern about the effectiveness of the low-flow operation, but this toilet appears to have a powerful flush. The tank is almost as large as the one on the old high-flow toilet, but the mechanism appears to meter less than half of the tank capacity for each flush. The weight of the remaining water provides more force for the limited water that is delivered in a flush. Each flush appears to clear the bowl completely, and we have not had any problems with it. This bowl height of this toilet is higher than the one that we replaced. Our consensus is that this height is more comfortable than the lower bowl, but I expect that is a matter of personal preference. This provided a good solution for our particular renovation need. It fits our small space, works well, and looks good.",5,13,1

Toilet works fine, and flush reasonably good. Though I'm very disappointed in the seat. If I knew that I would have bought the cheaper model without the soft close lid. There's no way to tighten the lid down from not sliding. Everytime one sit down the seat slide. To be expected from cheaply made plastic lids and seats. After spending this much on an American made toilet I have no choice but to spend more to get another aftermarket wooden seat and lid that won't slide. My advise, save your money and buy the regular model without soft close lid since you will be ending up spending extra on another seat and lid.",3,5,0

It was not smart height and it had a round front. It also didn't flush well at all. This unit on the other hand, is much nicer. It flushed well and with the elongated front, is much more comfortable to a man to use. The only carp is the hold down bolts are much too tall and the supplied caps don't cover them. Thus I had to use a hack saw to shorten the bolts so the decorative caps would work. The best solution would be to provide taller caps. The complete kit was a bonus and I installed it myself.

It is working fine and the flushing action is very powerful. Don't know how it works, but when you flush it sounds like water is being pushed in with force and sucked out as well. When we installed it, the tank bolts didn't line-up perfectly with the bowl so when we thought everything was ready to test, it leaked a little at one of the bolts. Loosening the bolt and wiggling a little resolved the problem and there has been no problem since then.

The contractor triple checked everything and by evening all three were leaking between the tank and the bowl. I called the contractor and he said he had concerns with the design of the cheap plastic bolts provided. He returned the next day with better bolts and washers. That didn't fix the problem because the bolt holes are not smooth allowing a flush (no pun intended) fit. We are replacing all three with American Standard toilets. Is Mansfield going to pay my contractor? Absolutely ridiculous their faulty manufacturing is going to cost me double installation. Bottom line save yourself the headache - DO NOT BUY.

I bought the toilet because its made in US and I figured it would be great quality. I didn’t check the reviews and I should have. This toilet has some QC issues and some included hardware is shoddy. The bolts holding down the tank were rubber pegs. It seemed ok at first but even tightened down they leaked. Also the holes between the base and the tank for the pegs were not alligned perfectly contributing to the leaking. I ended up installing the tank twice. The second time I put some wax from a left over wax ring around the peg and seated it in tank to water proof it. This resolved the leaking during the install. The second shoddy piece is the seat.

I chose this over similar models from the other names because it is American made and nicely priced. I like the 3"" rigid flapper with replaceable silicone rubber seal a lot. It closes with a slight bang, but the flush is amazingly powerful, especially considering the efficiency. I think a softer rubber universal replacement flapper would make it quieter, but in my powder room, the noise is no issue. I like that it has 3 tank bolts instead of 2. The patented bolt design is strange, but I still like it better than Kohler's 3-bolt/funky seal design. There is no need for lots of torque, but you must be methodical in tightening them. Do it gradually in an alternating pattern like with lug nuts. The documentation indicates the correct order. I learned if you rush that step, it will leak. Look out for stray bits of loose glazing in the tank box and make sure there are none in the fill valve before connecting the supply. The pre-assembled tank components required no adjustments at all.

The design on the outside looks like it will be easier to clean and keep clean as well. The flush sounds strong and seems to rinse the toilet bowl well. The flush is loud and makes a pretty good 'thunk' as the stopper drops in place. The chain needed adjusting and one of them broke as it was so thin. The flushing handle seems cheap and flimsy. The slow-close seats are plastic, very lightweight, take forever to close, and keep coming loose. We will be replacing them. The money we spent seemed to be in the china parts of these toilets.

My parents are very pleased. Cons, the seat that comes with it is poorly constructed, a disappointment. You will need to replace it. I’m not kidding, it’s that bad.

But it's turned out to be the most problematic toilet I've ever installed. I've probably installed around 20 over the last 20 years. The handle on the first one had a defect that caused the handle to stick and hold the flapper open. I had to lift the handle back up to make it close. I got another toilet and the handle worked fine. The donut that goes between the tank and the bowl is made of stiffer rubber than any other toilet I've installed. This stiffness appears to have caused the donut to leak. I purchased an after market donut that was squishy like normal and the leaks stopped. The tank bolts are a weird design. The seal is integral to the bolt. One out of three of these bolts kept leaking on me. I switched to the standard design with separate bolt and washer and it was fine. I wasted a lot of time on this toilet.,2,0,0

I am *generally* happy with my purchase, but there were a few things that posed an issue. First, the bolts that hold the toilet tank to the bowl; these are not washers and bolts that used to be standard (but seem to be with repair kits; go figure), but rather a bolt with a rubber head. I had difficulty with two of three bolts, in that they leaked. I had to loosen, reset, tighten and really torque the bolts down, to the point I was afraid I would crack the porcelain. I don't know why this was changed from the old rubber washer with separate bolt; I've never had any issues with that style leaking in the past. Second, the fill valve, although a Fluidmaster and a reputable brand, ""popped"" on the second day after install. I heard a horrific noise, and went to the bathroom to see what had happened. I thought a pipe had burst, only to find that the toilet water was now running. Lifting the lid, I found that the noise was caused by the top of the fill valve giving way, and hitting the toilet tank cover, which was now continually filling. Apparently a ""lesser quality"" fill valve was included, and I had to purchase another, adding $20 to the original cost of the toilet. Third, the flapper included is horrible. The bottom is made of plastic, not rubber, and consequently, when the flap closes, it makes a LOUD slapping sound. This too had to be replaced along with the fill valve, included in the Fluidmaster Repair Kit that I had to purchase. Why have a ""silent close"" lid, when the sound of the flapper closing is about a loud as a toilet seat dropping? Makes no sense. I imagine that ""cheaper"" lower quality fill valves come with the toilet. Please, either supply quality kits with the toilet and raise the price, or just don't supply them at all, and lower the price of the toilet. While it's been quite a few years since I had to purchase a new toilet, I realize that they are now made to conserve water, but what is the point if you have to flush the toilet three times in order to have a completely empty toilet? In general, it's a toilet. Personally, I'm not into the ""design"" as I am with the function. While it was convenient to have everything supplied for installation, it's still aggravating to have to go back to the store to replace an inferior quality fill valve and flap. The water conservation feature is something I will have to live with since this seems to be the standard now. Take away is this; hold onto your old toilet as long as you can, because prices are going up, and quality is going down.",3,1,0

Bought 2 for house with 3 toilets, wife primarily uses 2 of them so I wanted them to be the same so she wouldn't flop onto the shorter one. It is tall. You can read the other comments, I agree with them. So let me offer these suggestions. It is 95 pounds. I bought online so someone would deliver it to my car at Lowe's. At home, I opened the box in the driveway and carried it in two pieces rather than trying to lug a 95 pound box myself.The bottom is still heavy, hard on the back. New appreciation for plumbers. Regarding the flange bolts being too long, that is correct they need to be cut. After removing my current toilet and cleaning the area, I noticed those bolts were cut when installed originally in 1992. I reused them, no need to cut the ones that came with the toilet. The instructions talked about the waterline in the tank, which is not on the inside of the tank but on the white tube in the middle of the tank. Instructions say don't use galvanized hoses--they are not talking about the newer braided metal hoses, those are ok to use. If you don't crank the tank down, water will go all over when you flush, it is a bit different to use a socket on those 3 plastic nuts that hold the tank in place. Allow extra time for removal of the old one and cleaning up the area before the new installation. Removing the old one is just the reverse steps you will follow for the new installation, except you have to scoop out the water. In my case, the footprint of the old toilet was bigger than the new one, and I had to do some quick floor sanding and staining, sealing in two small places. I lined the area with paper towels to spot leaks for 3 days. Scraper tool helpful for old wax removal. Mansfield Customer Support called me back right away, I couldn't find the water line on the inside of the tank but when I was talking to the technician I saw it on that tube.",5,2,2

Based on the item I had, I cannot recommend this product. I will caveat this with the fact that I only tested one and it very well could haver been faulty. So check other reviews also to see if others had the same problems. First thing I noticed was a lot of powder that came off of the toilet, so you will want to wipe it off well before bringing it into the house. The porcelain mold also left something to be desired. The instructions were fairly straight forward with diagrams. To test this toilet, I placed it on a level surface, hooked it up to a garden hose, and hooked that up to a standard supply line. The hose water pressure was the same as the interior of the house. The first real issue was with the bowl gasket. It had a grove that should be able to go over a lip on the bowl, but there was no lip. Even with heavy tightening of the bolts, the gasket would not sit right (see photo 1). I even tried to seat it onto the bowl first and it still would not seat well (photo 2). The fill valve was way off from the proper adjustment. The water kept flowing. It took a lot of turns to get the water to the right level. I would have expected the fill valve to at least be close to the right setting. After I set the water level, I added a blue dye so I could see how well the water circulated in the bowl during a flush (Photo 3). It actually did quite well in covering all sides of the bowl (Photo 4). The last issue I had was with the flapper. Most flappers will open up and remain open until the tank is fairly empty. On this tank, I had to hold the handle down during the entire flush in order to empty the tank. Pressing and releasing a second or two resulted in half the tank not emptying (photo 5). This flapper could not go back because the fill tube was in the way (photo 6). Bad design? I try to give every product I test the benefit of the doubt, but unfortunately, if this particular unit is typical of the bulk of the toilets, I just cannot recommend it.",2,11,2

So the assembly was super easy, maybe cause I have rebuilt and replaced several toilets already. I did like that there is notches to rest against the tank once it is tightened down, making the tank feel more secure. I previously had installed an Danco perfect seal on the floor flange, Item #3844101. This is also the third time I have seated a toilet on this flange so I highly recommend picking up one. They are under all my toilets and make repairs and reinstalls so much easier then having to use a new wax ring. Once the toilet is installed, using wood shims to level, I slide a few paper straps under the toilet and flush repeated to check the seal. After 10 flushes, no water on paper, and I finish the install. The best part is our parents are now happier when they come to visit cause there is a taller toilet in the house.",5,7,0

I have a couple kids and am constantly asking them not to slam the lid. Nice that it’s not possible now. That said the lid (not the seat) is a little flimsy and I’m not able to sit on it without it bending in. I don’t think it’ll break but I also won’t be testing it. I also found the water refilling noise to be quite loud. I did turn the water down from fully open and that did eliminate it. Good to note if you have higher home water pressure. Other then that it’s been working great. If you’re looking to update the look of an older bathroom this could be a good fit.,4,5,0

It was packaged real well with abundant cardboard cushioning and placement in the box. So if you have to transport this toilet rest assured it is well packed. Next the toilet tank and lid are in their own box setting on the upside down bowl , the face of the bowl rests on about 1 3/8"" of cardboard. The weight of the bowl is impressively heavy, so it should stand up to heavy use by a family. The tank assembly has some very well designed components inside including the 3"" flapper assembly . The handle is all metal and should be strong enough to last. The unit comes complete with all mounting hardware and the soft close seat which is made from a long lasting polymer, easy to clean , with a finish that will not degrade. I think that this is a toilet that will satisfy the demands of most homeowners for a long time. It is a ADA compliant comfort height toilet which is a big plus.",5,2,0

The removal of a 30+ year old round toilet and the installation of this higher, elongated commode was a relatively easy process. I removed all the old wax ring, used my Simple Green to clean the floor and followed the simple instructions. I did adjust the tank level to a lower setting. This is a fast flush unit that will give you two flush cycles on one tank of water. So it is indeed a much more efficient unit than the old one and I think better than our two which are less than five years old.

The only thing that prevented me from giving it 5 stars, is that it is significantly loader when flushing then my previous toilet.

It has a very powerful flush, a really nice soft close lid, and good visual appeal. However; I dinged it two stars over one aspect... the design where the tank meets the base. It only utilizes 2 bolts, and they don't provide enough compression. The result is a tank that flexes if pressure is applied to it (such as sitting back to hard). It hasn't leaked, thankfully, but even after adding some rubber tape to stabilize it, there is still some flex, and I'm concerned this will become an issue over time.

The Toilet tank insulation lining is not bonded to the tank on the two sides therefore any contact with the liner in that area will break the liner. Also the tank bolt holes do not line up 100% to the bowel which caused the bolts to be installed on a slight angle which (on the first installation attempt) cause all three bolts to leak. After adding marine silicone to the bolt seals the bolt sealed fine but after filling the tank I found the tank (was cracked which was not cracked during installation). I had to return the toilet and purchased and American Standard with with liner for nearly the same price. The American Standard is is a much better toilet.

It's not appealing to enter the bathroom and have to see fragments left on the side of the bowl from the person who used it before you. previous toilet was 40 years old and never had this problem Seems like the water line is not high enough to cleanse it when flushed or not enough water coming down all around the upper part to wash away debris.,2,0,0

But, this disappointment of a toilet has drawn me in. I thought this toilet was going to be great. Loved the made in USA aspect. However, it's lousy. First, the flapper falls way too fast, forcing you to hold the handle down for the flush duration. I have tried adjusting the foam float and the chain, but no matter what, if you push the handle and let it go, the flapper immediately falls and shuts. The instructions provide NO guidance on how to tune the flush. Second, the seat it comes with is garbage. If you stand to urinate, the seat falls down while you are going. Luckily, it's a slow fall, so you can catch it midstream, if you are quick! That or it slowing falls through the stream, rather than quickly passing through! Third, the flush is weak. Even holding the handle down the whole time, it is poor. No comparison to the American Standard (made in Thailand unfortunately) we have in the other bathroom. Pass on this toilet!!! After a week of use, I am considering pulling it and trying to get a refund or at least writing Lowes to try and get credit for a replacement seat and an adjustable fall rate flapper.",2,2,3

I called and spoke with them twice while deciding on purchasing this and they were very helpful. It's pretty (no logos on it anywhere, my wife likes handle on the side) and is solidly built/heavy. The flush is very strong when you hold the handle down (see dislikes) and it has anti-stick coating like other higher-end brand toilets. I chose it over similar American Standard (Champion) and Kohler (Cimmaron) toilets available at Lowes because these toilets have serious quality control issues (cracking and issues with flush valves, respectively). I did NOT use the included wax ring but instead used the Danco 4.75-in Toilet Wax Ring with Bolts Item #: 3844101 Model #: 10826X which I highly recommend as this allows you to reposition toilet if needed and it's a very secure fit on this toilet. Dislikes: You must hold the handle down to get a good flush. I talked to Mansfield about this and it's the way it's designed. The flapper they have doesn't float at all. I have purchased a new flapper to try from HomeDepot (Fluidmaster Universal 3 in. Premium Adjustable Toilet Flapper) that I'm hoping will allow for a good flush without holding the handle down. The flush is loud and the flapper slams down hard if you don't hold the handle down long enough. Also, it takes a long time for the tank to fill after flushing and it's louder than our previous toilet-most of the water goes into the bowl and not the tank. My wife feels the toilet sits a little high, but I'm fine with it-we're the same height so personal preference. Overall I'm pretty happy with the toilet and was VERY impressed with Mansfield's customer service. I had a hard time finding any information about this toilet before I bought, so I'm hoping this review helps other people decide on it.",4,1,1

This one was no exception, what should have been a two hour project took almost three times as long. First remove the old toilet only to find the flange is destroyed and will take ingenuity and lots of work. Many hours later I have the new flange and wax ring (provided with this toilet) in place ready for installation. This toilet bolted in very easily but I had to use plastic connector bolt different from the ones provided. These were recommended by a plumber when I was addressing the broken flange issue. I went to connect the toilet to the water supply but alas they did not provide that water line. Trying to reuse the old one it broke because part of it was plastic. It took three trips to Lowe’s to get the correct new shut-off valve and water fill line. Mostly my fault for not trying the connection at the store. The best part of this whole installation was the toilet itself, in the past I would have had to install the guts of the toilet myself adding time and expense. While this is only the third toilet I have ever installed it was by far the easiest. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone looking to install a new toilet. I did spend a bit of time hunting for the plastic bolts for the seat, and finally decided to use the old ones figuring that they were not shipped or that I had misplaced them. After the new seat was installed I lifted the lid to conduct a test flush only to find the new plastic bolts taped conveniently to the underside of the lid.",4,14,1

The original toilet was 38 years old and a high-water-use type toilet. I had previously installed three other toilets in other bathrooms in the house. This toilet was the easiest to install, but that is largely because there weren't any issues with the flange or flooring flatness (no shims required) like in the other rooms. The kit contained everything I needed. Sometimes if things aren't so square, you'll need shims to level the toilet and possibly a problem-solver seal, rather than the supplied wax ring. The only non-obvious part of the install was the plastic rings that hold the plastic dome caps that cover the mounting bolts for the bottom portion of the toilet. I had to put on my glasses to see that they are marked with ""this side up"" text. As a tip, I used some tools on the floor as guides as to where the flange bolts were as I lowered the base down onto the flange seal. I have included a photos of what I'm speaking of for clarity. The longest part of the install was cleaning around the area, which is typical in my experience. The flush works well, but not quite as powerful as a toilet costing three times as much. For the pool room, this will be just fine.",5,7,0

Instructions were simple and the rubber-headed tank bolts create a great seal. That said, a few things to keep in mind: 1. Buy an extra wax ring. If you’ve had a remodel that includes granite or marble flooring, odds are good the supplied ring won’t be thick enough to create a good seal. Having a second ring will allow you to double the depth. Wax rings run about $2.00, so go ahead and splurge—it could save you a trip back to the store; 2. When attaching the tank, you’ll need to stretch the rubber gasket a bit to seat it flush to the bottom of the tank. The instructions are a bit vague on that, and you’ll be going through a couple of towels if you don’t! The toilet itself is pretty good. The oblong shape is far more comfortable than traditional round bowls. A quick flick of the handle drains about half the tank (thereby conserving water) and holding the handle down will completely drain it (for when a little more oomph is needed). What I like best is that the tank is very quiet when refilling. All said, a good product that’s easy to install.",5,5,0

That's what I need it to do and it does it well. Waste goes away when I hit flush...that's a win. For install, it went smoothly. Removed the old toilet, cleaned the old wax off the flange, then began installing the new toilet. I only have one criticism...the hardware kit that comes with the toilet doesn't have the nice little plastic washers to help hold the flange bolts up while you install the bowl. You can see in pic #3 where I used small pieces of cardboard to hold the bolts up. It works, but it wouldn't be too much to ask for Mansfield to include simple, cheap, thin plastic washers to hold the bolts up. Other than that, install was smooth. Got the bowl installed then put the tank on the back. After that, I connected the water feed, turned on the water, and checked for leaks...there were none! It was a smooth install and the toilet does exactly what a toilet should. The waste goes away and I know I have a quality toilet that is going to last!",5,4,0

The toilet has a large jet at the bottom that helps push waste to the drain (see photo). THE NEUTRAL: The flapper has a unique design as the hole on one side is larger than the hole on the other side. Not a big deal as Lowe's sells the Mansfield flapper (item # 4133941). If you care to upgrade to a better flapper, you will greatly increase your flush performance (Lowe's item # 4133941), see photo. The Fluid Master fill valve comes with a flow restrictor which means that it takes a long time to refill the tank after each flush. Instructions for removing the flow restrictor can be found my Googling ""How to remove the toilet fill valve regulator."" COULD BE BETTER: There are no rubber washers or spacers used to level & support the tank as you secure it to the toilet. After failing to get a good seal, I placed 3 tank toilet washers on top of each of the 3 holes on the toilet, then I placed the tank on the toilet (see photo). The Lowe's item # on the tank washers is 3625389. The tank was immediately level and stable, and the seal was perfect. Overall the Mansfield toilet is a quality product at a good price. If you add the rubber tank washers as spacers, you don't have to worry about porcelain to porcelain contact as the tank to toilet washer is compressed by the weight of the water in the tank. As stated, you can upgrade to the other brand flapper and greatly improve your flush performance.",4,3,0

The tank bolts are worthless - no matter how carefully you tighten them, they WILL LEAK until you use silicone around them, so save yourself the problem and tighten them fully then silicone them. As for use, one of these has been in service for nearly two years. Frankly, if any other toilet had been in stock, I would not have bought a second one. The first one will plug up at the drop of a hat, so keep a plunger handy. The even better part is the shape of the outlet in the bottom of the bowl doesn't allow the plunger to completely seal, so it's quite difficult to clear once it gets plugged. I have taken the first one out multiple times to be sure there wasn't something stuck, and the entire passageway is clear. I'd say faulty design. The newest one is in a guest bathroom, so it seldom gets the ""workout"" that the main toilet sees.",3,4,0

Super high quality with all the parts. The seat is an ingenious idea and works great. The swirl jet gets everything out the first time. The only issue I had on the installation is getting the tank to seal with the bowl. I don’t like the idea of only having the front of the tank come in contact with the bowl. It leaves it open to over tighten the tank and crack it. For that reason I was a leery of over tightening it. Took the tank back off several times to insure it was installed correctly.

I notice immediately it was much heavier that the Kol toilet it was replacing. Nothing cheap about it. Guts are standard flowmaster, nothing fancy but solid stuff. Packaged perfect, parts in individual boxes with good instructions. Delivery was delayed but it's holiday time so not a problem. Easy installation for most part. Toilet mount bolts were too short for my tiled floor. Had to purchase 3.5 lag bolts, no big deal. Toilet water bowl is the 2 bolt mount. No issue with leaks, bolted up nice, however still has a little tilt forward so I shimmed tank with small piece of plastic shim to level it out. Toilet seat self closing- First time I ever had to look at instructions to mount a toilet seat! Probably took longer to mount seat that the complete toilet. Didn't help that my wife was watching and wanted it perfectly line up! Very satisfied with this toilet. No leaks, straight forward install. Very quiet operation. Flushes well and cleans up easy.

It seems when you order online, the piece packed for you is the worst piece which they want to get rid off.

I tried many times, filled water to full level in tank and pressed lever down from full to empty, but each time it only covered half of the bowl.

It’s a nuisance and looks disgusting. I can’t imagine guests using this toilet. Then there’s this thing with the flushing lever. I don’t understand why it has to be held down for a period of time, for it to flush.
