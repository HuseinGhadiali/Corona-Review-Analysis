Review
"The size and high of the toilet is really good. The instructions for installation were not clear, but even then I was happy with the purchase. The problem comes around two months after the purchase, every time we flush water goes for up to five to ten minutes, we have to manually arrange it. it is very disappointing."
Unfortunately needed a smaller toilet at a specific height to be able to get a ADA toliet chair over. This was the only one that met those specific needs. I’ve never needed a toilet plunger before and had to run out to buy one. Unfortunately it gets used almost daily since the toilet gets clogged easily.
"My teens kept telling me the toilet was clogged, but it wasn't, they just weren't holding the handle down long enough. It's at a point though where multiple people keep doing this and I'd have to put up a tacky sign telling people to press and hold to flush. No thank you. It has a weak flush and doesn't seem to flush all the way out. The handle is plastic and feels cheap. It's comfortable to sit on though and install was easy. I do prefer elongated and standard height (I'm 5'3"" so chair height doesn't let my feet fully touch the ground) but I will be returning this toilet for a different one. That's how annoying this flush is. I'm literally going to take this dang thing back for a different one."
difficult to get a good seal around the tank bolts. Multiple problems with leaks. Doesn't flush that well either and is prone to clogs. There are other toilets on the market in this price range that perform much better.
Bought two for my contractors to install. One tank was cracked at the seam which was obvious only after filling with water and that water all over my brand new luxury vinyl floors. The tank upstairs is installed properly but leaks slightly at every flush. Not sure what the malfunction is with these toilets. Either a design flaw or manufacturing quality defect.
"While installing, found the flange nuts were not included. Was able to reuse my old ones for now. Perhaps more important was that the new flange bolts were present. Package did include an extra set of caps (which do me no good). Just purchased a second toilet to install today. This ""kit"" is also missing the flange nuts but more frustrating is the flange bolts are missing as well! I am not going to assume my old bolts are OK and I am not going to get the old toilet removed to find out then. It looks like I need to make another trip back into town, buy my own nuts and bolts along with using $10 in gas before I can start this project. I was happy to purchase something ""made in USA"" but I am very disappointed that the people packaging these so called ""kits"" can't do a better job. Somebody on the assembly line needs a pep talk."
Installation was easy enough finding all the required parts inside the box. However we found it infuriating installing a round toilet bowl to get to the last step of putting on the toilet seat cover only to see that it is an elongated bowl seat!! Don't know how this can happen and not going to un-install an entire toilet to change out the toilet seat cover but completely frustrating and would like to know how this could be resolved!
The packing and handling of these toilets are sub-par. Returned the first one because base was cracked. Second one had a hairline crack also.
"Followed instructions - installation was easy enough but I would not recommend this toilet. The flush is very weak, you will need to flush at least twice to clean out a #2. I tried messing with the water levels etc. but nothing worked. Look for a toilet that has a much better flush/flow."
I bought this toilet because I wanted made in the USA. Easy installation and looks good. The problem is it takes 5 minutes to fill the toilet. I checked my water pressure going into the toilet and everything is good. Somewhere in the internal mechanics it only allows a trickle. Very disappointed.
I am very aggravated at the flushing. It doesn't get all the debris off the walls of the toilet and it seems I am going to have to clean the toilet after every use. It's not appealing to enter the bathroom and have to see fragments left on the side of the bowl from the person who used it before you. previous toilet was 40 years old and never had this problem Seems like the water line is not high enough to cleanse it when flushed or not enough water coming down all around the upper part to wash away debris.
Not the quality I was hoping for. I installed another mansfield toilet and it was all good. This one had chips in tank top. Not visible so I continued on. Well months later when the tank stops filling it squeels like a bad horn. I
"A toilet is a toilet. As long as it flushes with power and stuff goes down the drain without clogging it has done its job. However, not all toilet installs are created equal. I bought the toilet because its made in US and I figured it would be great quality. I didn’t check the reviews and I should have. This toilet has some QC issues and some included hardware is shoddy. The bolts holding down the tank were rubber pegs. It seemed ok at first but even tightened down they leaked. Also the holes between the base and the tank for the pegs were not alligned perfectly contributing to the leaking. I ended up installing the tank twice. The second time I put some wax from a left over wax ring around the peg and seated it in tank to water proof it. This resolved the leaking during the install. The second shoddy piece is the seat. Again the bolts didnt properly align with the holes in the base so I am not sure how long it will take before the hinges crack. Once installed the toilet does toilet things as you would expect. For installation save yourself the headache and go with a different brand."
The seat is very small and the lid does not close well. The screw that holds the lid on stripped after about a week and had to be replaced. Not a good toilet for the price.
